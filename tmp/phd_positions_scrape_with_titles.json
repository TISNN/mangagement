Do you want to explore physics that nobody else has seen? Maybe you want to join our team as a PhD on our exciting journey towards the superradiant and zero-deadtime clocks. We are the\nultracold strontium group\nat the University of Amsterdam and you can read more about the project\nhere\n.\nJoin Us!\nThis PhD position is part of the European doctoral network\nQuRIOUS\n, which has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon Europe research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement number 101227522. You will participate in network meetings across Europe, where you will learn about quantum technology from experts in the field and train essential skills, such as academic writing and outreach. You will participate in a summer school and regular consortium meetings with the other PhDs. You will spend time in the lab of a consortium partner.\nThis is what you will do\nWith this project, you will join\na team of experimental quantum physicists\nat the\nUniversity of Amsterdam\nwho are building two new types of optical clock. Optical clocks are the most precise measurement instruments in the world, going wrong by only one second over the lifetime of the universe. They enable searches for beyond standard model physics, can explore quantum many-body systems, and have practical applications in geodesy, navigation and network synchronization.\nState-of-the-art optical clocks are working in a pulsed fashion and need hours of averaging to reach their final accuracy. A main goal of our research is to reduce this to a few minutes, which would open new opportunities for clocks. We want to achieve this by creating clocks that can be operated truly continuously, using technology that we have developed to achieve continuous Bose-Einstein condensation [\nNature\n606\n, 683 (2022)\n]. We are building two types of such clocks: a superradiant clock and a zero-deadtime clock. A superradiant clock is a laser that lases on an ultranarrow optical transition. You can read about our plans for this clock in\nSheng Zhou’s PhD thesis\n. For the zero-deadtime clock, we supply atoms from a continuous ultracold Sr source to four clock interrogation zones that are in one vacuum chamber. Clock interrogation can always be executed in at least one zone, while others are reloaded with atoms, enabling continuous operation. We have one PhD opening on each of these sub-projects.\nThis project is embedded in the\nQDNL\nUltracold Atom Quantum Sensing Testbed\n, which will allow you to learn about many interesting projects related to your PhD, such as creating a European optical time and frequency distribution network, building\nan industry prototype of an optical clock\n, building continuously operating atom interferometers, or\nimproving the way in which optics is built\n.\nOur group\nhas furthermore quantum simulation experiments using Rb-Sr mixtures or single Sr atoms in optical tweezer arrays. Your PhD project will profit from synergy with all these activities.\nWhat we ask of you\n- at least 8 months of master project in experimental ultracold atom or trapped ion group;\n- good team working skills;\n- good English skills;\n- experience with at least a few of the following: experimental work with optics, lasers, electronics, experiment control software;\n- some experience with data analysis;\n- strong letter of recommendation from master project supervisor;\n- Beneficial skill: programming, including some languages of the following list: C, C++, Python, Matlab, Mathematica. Programming skills will be used to build experiment control systems, data analysis systems, and to perform numerical simulations of experiments.\nFor MSCA PhD positions it is required that the applicant shall at the date of recruitment be in the first four years (full-time equivalent research experience) of their research careers and have not been awarded a doctoral degree. The applicant must not have resided or carried out her/his main activity (e.g. work or studies) in the Netherlands for more than 12 months in the three years immediately prior the recruitment date.\nThis is what we offer you\nA temporary contract for 38 hours per week for the duration of 4 years (the initial contract will be for a period of 18 months and after satisfactory evaluation it will be extended for a total duration of 4 years). The preferred starting date is 1 October 2025 or as soon as possible after that. This should lead to a dissertation (PhD thesis). We will draft an educational plan that includes attendance of courses and (international) meetings. We also expect you to assist in teaching undergraduates and master students.\nYou will work in this team\nThe\nFaculty of Science\nhas a student body of around 8,000, as well as 1,800 members of staff working in education, research or support services.

Join our ERC-funded project and uncover the physics behind inertial dense suspensions, flows that shape technologies from energy storage to biomedical systems.\nJob description\nInertial Dense Suspensions (IDeS) are common in nature and industry, with examples ranging from blood flow and recycling to waste slurry transport, additive manufacturing, and energy storage solutions. Despite their practical importance, these flows remain poorly understood. As a result, even the most basic properties cannot be predicted reliably. For instance, the best available models over- or underestimate the measured pressure drop in a suspension pipe flow by 30–40% across different flow rates. This makes designing and controlling these flows difficult. The difficulty arises partly because these flows do not fit the conventional ‘laminar’ versus ‘turbulent’ classification; they inhabit a terra incognita. Most theoretical studies so far have focused on confined suspensions in the viscous regime, but this idealized approach is insufficient for practical applications. Finite particle size and velocity introduce complex inertial phenomena, such as particle-induced fluctuations, a gradual transition to turbulence, and shear-induced migration. These effects are at best only qualitatively understood, yet they profoundly alter the flow behavior. Understanding and accurately modelling these flows will enable more energy-efficient transport of industrial slurries, improve our understanding of blood flow, and support the development of sustainable manufacturing processes.\nThese PhD-positions are part of the\nERC Advanced Grant project IDeS\nwhere you will join a team investigating densely-laden pipe flows. Two PhD positions are available within the project:\n- PhD 1 will focus on optical techniques to quantify the near-wall behavior using volumetric flow measurement techniques (e.g. Lagrangian particle tracking or tomo-PIV) and model the fluctuations that are introduced by the particles. The interaction of the fluctuations with the transition to turbulence will also be investigated and captured in a physical model.\ninteraction of the fluctuations with the transition to turbulence\n- PhD 2 will work on ultrasound imaging velocimetry combined with shadowgraphy to quantify the shear-induced migration of particles, and capture this in a model. The role of volume fraction, particle size, Reynolds number and density ratio will be investigated and captured in a model.\nultrasound imaging velocimetry\nWhile the challenging scientific goals of each project are distinct, we expect a close collaboration to work towards the final goal of being able to predict these flows.\nYour work environment\nYou will be part of the\nMultiphase Systems group\nwithin the\nProcess & Energy Department\nat TU Delft. The group studies fundamental and applied aspects of multiphase flows, combining advanced experiments and state-of-the-art numerical simulations. Research focuses on dense dispersions, turbulence interacting with free surfaces, and transitions in particle-laden flows, with applications ranging from slurries and food emulsions to 3D printing and transport of floating structures.\nWithin the group, you will work in a collaborative and international environment, which has access to\nunique experimental facilities\nsuch as MRI, X-ray, and ultrasound imaging, alongside high-performance computing resources. The positions include conducting experimental research, publishing in peer-reviewed journals, presenting at conferences, and mentoring BSc and MSc students.

      "description_en": "Work Activities\nWe are seeking a motivated PhD- student to join our teams working on bistable elements for in-materia computing, as part of a joint theoretical/experimental program carried out at AMOLF (Amsterdam) and TU/e (Eindhoven).\nComputing with artificial neurons takes inspiration from nature’s efficient, adaptive use of multistable networks, offering an alternative to energy-intensive digital systems with rigid bits and separated memory and computation. In this project, we aim to design and realize the first networks combining active and passive electronic neurons, using organic electronics for chemical and electrical tunability. This work is based on recent breakthroughs in our groups.\nThe Van Hecke group recently showed that passive, bistable hysterons excel at sequential tasks such as counting1,2, whereas the group of van de Burgt has built active electronic neurons that mimic spiking3,4. Surprisingly, we found that spiking neurons can be described as ‘active’ hysterons, forming a bridge between two distinct frameworks for in-materia computing. Hence, by combining active and passive elements we aim to combine the best of both worlds, endowing passive networks with adaptability and spiking networks with memory and sequencing. We will explore the computational power of these systems and demonstrate it in simple robots. Our work bridges organic neural systems and hysteron computing, and leverages (bio)chemical and electrical feedback to materialize adaptivity and plasticity.\nKey questions include: How to realize and design mixed networks of passive and active artificial neurons? How do mixed networks extend the class of realizable computing? Do our networks exhibit spiking, bursting or synchronization, and how to control these behaviors?

        "description": "<strong>Work Activities</strong><br>\n   We are seeking a motivated PhD- student to join our teams working on bistable elements for in-materia computing, as part of a joint theoretical/experimental program carried out at AMOLF (Amsterdam) and TU/e (Eindhoven). <br> <br> Computing with artificial neurons takes inspiration from nature’s efficient, adaptive use of multistable networks, offering an alternative to energy-intensive digital systems with rigid bits and separated memory and computation. In this project, we aim to design and realize the first networks combining active and passive electronic neurons, using organic electronics for chemical and electrical tunability. This work is based on recent breakthroughs in our groups. <br> The Van Hecke group recently showed that passive, bistable hysterons excel at sequential tasks such as counting1,2, whereas the group of van de Burgt has built active electronic neurons that mimic spiking3,4. Surprisingly, we found that spiking neurons can be described as ‘active’ hysterons, forming a bridge between two distinct frameworks for in-materia computing. Hence, by combining active and passive elements we aim to combine the best of both worlds, endowing passive networks with adaptability and spiking networks with memory and sequencing. We will explore the computational power of these systems and demonstrate it in simple robots. Our work bridges organic neural systems and hysteron computing, and leverages (bio)chemical and electrical feedback to materialize adaptivity and plasticity. <br> <br> Key questions include: How to realize and design mixed networks of passive and active artificial neurons? How do mixed networks extend the class of realizable computing? Do our networks exhibit spiking, bursting or synchronization, and how to control these behaviors? How to realize targeted sequential and adaptive computations? Can we develop neuronal circuits for maze-solving and sequential adaptation? To answer these questions, the project will involve computational modelling and experimental work, jointly supervised by Martin van Hecke and Yoeri van de Burgt.

Yet, they are increasingly exposed to NaTech events—natural hazards that trigger technological accidents—which can have devastating impacts on people, infrastructure, and the environment. Addressing these risks is one of the urgent challenges for ensuring safe and sustainable industrial operations.\nAs a PhD candidate in Resilience Assessment and Management for NaTech-Exposed Process Industries at TU Delft, you will contribute to tackling this challenge directly. You will be part of a research project that aims to design an integrated framework for assessing and managing resilience, tailored specifically to the needs of the process industries. This framework will not only provide methods to evaluate vulnerabilities and risks, but also deliver practical tools to support decision-making under uncertainty.\nIn this project, you will combine engineering design principles with stakeholder engagement approaches, ensuring that the developed methods are robust, adaptable, and grounded in real-world practice. You will apply advanced techniques such as agent-based modelling, quantitative resilience assessment, and risk analysis to simulate and optimise resilience strategies.\nThe framework will be tested and refined through pilot studies in collaboration with industrial and regulatory partners, ensuring its relevance and applicability in practice. You will also work alongside a diverse team of researchers and stakeholders from different disciplines and sectors, gaining valuable experience in interdisciplinary collaboration and bridging science, engineering, and policy.\nYour work environment\nYou will be part of the\nSafety and Security Science Section\nwithin the\nDepartment of Values, Technology and Innovation (VTI)\nat TU Delft’s Faculty of Technology, Policy and Management. The section investigates socio-technical systems and decision-making on technical, human and organisational dimensions, focusing on safety, security and resilience through responsible risk management. Research areas include critical infrastructure protection, systems resilience, crisis governance, uncertainty in complex systems, and the interface between technology and human organisations.\nYou’ll engage with an interdisciplinary community that bridges engineering, behavioural science and policy to co-design approaches for safer, more robust systems. Collaboration is central: you’ll work alongside government agencies, industry partners, and cross-disciplinary research teams. In VTI’s open and reflective environment, you’ll benefit from cross-section learning, strong mentorship and tailored training. With minimal hierarchical barriers and access to\nstate-of-the-art facilities, labs and equipment\n, you’ll be supported to grow professionally and contribute to both foundational theory and real-world impact.\nConsortium\nThis position is part of a European Doctoral Network consortium\nREUNATECH- NATECH\nRisk Management and Resilience of High-Tech Industries and Critical Infrastructures across Europe.\nEU funding for research into technological accidents caused by natural hazards\n.\nTU Delft (Delft University of Technology)\nDelft University of Technology is built on strong foundations.

Research methods will include statistical analyses, modelling and potentially farm interviews.<br><br><strong>Your team</strong><br>Together with pioneering Dutch farmers, the ReGeNL project is working to build an agricultural sector in which food production goes hand in hand with soil health, nature restoration, and a viable business model for farmers. By 2030, the project will draw on the experiences of 100 pioneering farmers to support around 1,000 farmers in the Netherlands in transitioning to regenerative practices, with the ambition of making regenerative agriculture the new norm by 2040.<br><br>Within ReGeNL, you will join work package 3B which develops predictive models at various scales. In 3B, a wide range of topics will be modelled to identify which combinations of practices deliver positive agricultural, socio-economic, and environmental outcomes. As such, you will become part of a cohort of PhD candidates working on related topics, giving ample opportunities for shared learning activities.<br><br><strong>You will work here </strong><br>This research is embedded within two research groups: the Plant Production Systems group and the Earth Systems and Global Change group, with supervision by dr. Renske Hijbeek and prof. dr. Hananh van Zanten.<br><br>The Plant Production Systems group combines production ecological theory with empirical knowledge to provide a better understanding of sustainability of farming systems around the world.<br>The Earth Systems and Global Change Group is a solution-oriented multidisciplinary research group focusing on sustainability and global change.",

      "description_en": "The Faculty of Science and the Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science (LIACS) are looking for a:\nPhD Candidate in Emotionally and Socially Aware Natural Language Processing (1.0fte)\nProject description\nCurrent Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems, and especially large language models (LLMs), are interacting with human emotions more readily than earlier AI systems, but we still lack frameworks to understand and shape these interactions. These systems often reproduce and even enlarge social biases, generate toxic context, or do not respond safely to emotional cues. This is because language, in the training of these systems, is treated mainly as data rather than as a social practice shaped by people, culture, and context.\nThis PhD project investigates how to make NLP systems emotionally and socially aware. The goal is to move beyond accuracy by understanding how people engage with these systems and creating models that respond safely to emotional cues, respect cultural variation, and adapt to human interaction. This requires rethinking both what we measure and how we design models. The PhD candidate will:\n- Create datasets and benchmarks that capture emotional cues, conversational norms, and cultural variation beyond English;\n- Run user studies to understand how people perceive and collaborate with conversational AI, paying attention to trust, cultural sensitivity, and affective interaction;\n- Design methods and metrics to evaluate bias, fairness, inclusivity, safety, and emotional responsiveness;\n- Explore applications such as conversational agents, mental well-being, and education, where emotion safety is crucial;\n- Design interventions to reduce bias and improve fairness and safety in human-AI interaction.\nThe research will combine computational modeling (e.g., NLP, machine learning, deep learning) with human-centered research (e.g., user studies, experimental design, qualitative analysis). We are looking not only for technical skills, but also for curiosity about how people experience language technologies emotionally and socially, and how AI shapes these interactions. Background or interest in areas like bias and fairness, emotion and affective interaction, or user-centered evaluation will be a strong advantage.\nThe successful PhD candidate will be embedded in the Human AI cluster, at the Leiden Institute for Advanced Computer Science (LIACS) at Leiden University, supervised by Dr. Flor Miriam Plaza del Arco, Prof. Suzan Verberne and Prof. Joost Broekens. More information about the Human AI cluster can be found at\nhttps://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/science/computer-science/research/human-ai\n.\nKey responsibilities\n- Conduct original and novel research in the field of socially aware and trustworthy NLP;\n- Publish and present scientific articles in international conferences (e.g., ACL, EMNLP) and journals;\n- Collaborate with colleagues in interdisciplinary settings;\n- Assist in relevant teaching and supervision activities at LIACS;\n- Write a dissertation.\nSelection Criteria\n- A MSc degree in Computer Science, Natural Language Processing, Artificial Intelligence, Computational Linguistics or a related field;\n- Strong background in NLP, machine learning, and deep learning.\n- Excellent programming skills (preferably in Python), with experience in fine-tuning language models and working with deep learning frameworks (e.g., PyTorch);\n- Interest in interdisciplinary research (e.g., HCI, computational social science, affective computing);\n- Ability to work with a high degree of independence and eagerness to contribute your own ideas, and collaborating within a team;\n- Good writing and presentation skills;\n- Interested in contributing to educational activities and public engagement;\n- Excellent proficiency in English (oral and written).\nResearch at our faculty\nThe Faculty of Science is a world-class faculty where staff and students work together in a dynamic international environment. It is a faculty where personal and academic development are top priorities.

        "description": "The Faculty of Science and the Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science (LIACS) are looking for a:<br><br><strong>PhD Candidate in Emotionally and Socially Aware Natural Language Processing (1.0fte)</strong><br><br><strong>Project description</strong><br>Current Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems, and especially large language models (LLMs), are interacting with human emotions more readily than earlier AI systems, but we still lack frameworks to understand and shape these interactions. These systems often reproduce and even enlarge social biases, generate toxic context, or do not respond safely to emotional cues. This is because language, in the training of these systems, is treated mainly as data rather than as a social practice shaped by people, culture, and context.<br><br>This PhD project investigates how to make NLP systems emotionally and socially aware. The goal is to move beyond accuracy by understanding how people engage with these systems and creating models that respond safely to emotional cues, respect cultural variation, and adapt to human interaction. This requires rethinking both what we measure and how we design models. The PhD candidate will:<br><ul> <li>Create datasets and benchmarks that capture emotional cues, conversational norms, and cultural variation beyond English;</li> <li>Run user studies to understand how people perceive and collaborate with conversational AI, paying attention to trust, cultural sensitivity, and affective interaction;</li> <li>Design methods and metrics to evaluate bias, fairness, inclusivity, safety, and emotional responsiveness;</li> <li>Explore applications such as conversational agents, mental well-being, and education, where emotion safety is crucial;</li> <li>Design interventions to reduce bias and improve fairness and safety in human-AI interaction.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>The research will combine computational modeling (e.g., NLP, machine learning, deep learning) with human-centered research (e.g., user studies, experimental design, qualitative analysis). We are looking not only for technical skills, but also for curiosity about how people experience language technologies emotionally and socially, and how AI shapes these interactions. Background or interest in areas like bias and fairness, emotion and affective interaction, or user-centered evaluation will be a strong advantage.<br><br>The successful PhD candidate will be embedded in the Human AI cluster, at the Leiden Institute for Advanced Computer Science (LIACS) at Leiden University, supervised by Dr. Flor Miriam Plaza del Arco, Prof. Suzan Verberne and Prof. Joost Broekens.

      "description_en": "Work Activities\nThis fully funded PhD position lies at the interface between fundamental physics and industrial application. It is part of activities in ARCNL’s Source Department. The research activities of the Source Department and its\nEUV Plasma Processes\ngroup aim at the atomic- and molecular-level understanding of the fundamental dynamics in the operation of contemporary and future plasma-based sources of extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) light for nanolithography.\nIn our group’s research we, for example, uncovered the quantum origins of the generated EUV light [Torretti, Nature Comms. Nature Commun.\n11\n, (2020)], found a universal law for expanding plasma [Sheil, Phys. Rev. Lett.\n133\n, (2024)], and found that less than half the initial droplet volume is present on thin tin sheet targets as used in EUV sources [Liu, Phys. Rev. Appl.\n20\n, (2023)], and work on an alternative EUV source solution [Mostafa, Appl. Phys. Lett.\n123\n, (2023)].\nBackground\nThe revolutionary introduction of EUV lithography was the culmination of several decades of collaborative work between industry and science – a Project Apollo of the digital age. The short, 13.5-nm EUV wavelength enables patterning the smallest, smartest, and most energy-efficient features on chips. The required 13.5-nm radiation is generated from plasma that is produced from tiny tin droplets that are heated by powerful laser pulses. At ARCNL, we are now thinking about the next generation of light sources: Can we make more efficient and more powerful EUV sources? Is it possible to make light sources that emit radiation efficiently at even shorter wavelengths?\nProject goal\nTo identify what light source will power the next generation of lithography machines, we need to understand what plasma conditions are optimal for producing light from plasma, but also we need to understand how such plasma should be generated, and what laser technology should be used. You will join an interdisciplinary team of several PhD students and postdocs in ARCNL’s highly cohesive Source Department and have as an objective to design & execute experiments, and work with advanced laser technologies, to understand the emission of light and ions from plasma that you generate.\nQualifications\n- You have (or will soon obtain) an MSc degree in (Applied) Physics\n- Knowledge of experimental laser physics and/or plasma and fluid mechanics is an asset, especially if combined with strong hands-on laboratory skills\n- Programming experience, particularly in Python, is welcomed\n- Strong verbal and written communication skills in English are required\nWork environment\nThe Advanced Research Center for Nanolithography (ARCNL) focuses on the fundamental physics and chemistry involved in current and future key technologies in nanolithography, primarily for the semiconductor industry. ARCNL is a public-private partnership between the Dutch Research Council (NWO), the University of Amsterdam (UvA), the VU University Amsterdam (VU), and associate partner the University of Groningen (UG), and the semiconductor equipment manufacturer ASML. ARCNL is located at the Amsterdam Science Park, The Netherlands, and has a size of approximately 100 scientists and support staff. See also\nwww.arcnl.nl\nWorking conditions\nARCNL offers you:\n- Responsibility over a setup including state-of-the-art droplet generators and laser systems\n- The ability to improve your experimental skills in extensive experimental campaigns that can be designed with a lot of freedom\n- Collaboration with the in-house theory group, allowing you to understand the EUV-emitting plasma through radiation-hydrodynamics simulations\n- Large amount of (image) data and a wide range of existing data analysis tools, allowing you to apply and develop your data analysis skills\n- Cooperation within a large team of PhD- students and postdocs and with a large industrial partner\n- The opportunity to show your work at (international) conferences for industry and academia\nThe position is intended as full-time (40 hours / week, 12 months / year) appointment in the service of the Netherlands Foundation of Scientific Research Institutes (NWO-I) for the duration of four years, with a starting salary of gross € 2,968 per month, with annual increases throughout the term of employment, as well as a\nrange of employment benefits\nincluding a high-end laptop. After successful completion of the PhD research a PhD degree will be granted at a Dutch University. Several courses are offered, specially developed for PhD-students. ARCNL assists any new foreign PhD-student with housing and visa applications and compensates their transport costs and furnishing expenses.\nMore information?\nFor further information about the position, please contact Oscar Versolato:\nDr. Oscar Versolato\nGroup leader EUV Plasma Processes\nE-mail:\nversolato@arcnl.nl\nPhone: +31 (0)20-851 7100\nDiversity code\nARCNL is highly committed to an inclusive and diverse work environment: we want to develop talent and creativity by bringing together people from different backgrounds and cultures.

        "description": "<strong>Work Activities</strong><br>This fully funded PhD position lies at the interface between fundamental physics and industrial application. It is part of activities in ARCNL’s Source Department. The research activities of the Source Department and its <a href=\"https://arcnl.nl/research-groups/euv-plasma-processes\">EUV Plasma Processes</a> group aim at the atomic- and molecular-level understanding of the fundamental dynamics in the operation of contemporary and future plasma-based sources of extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) light for nanolithography.<br><br>In our group’s research we, for example, uncovered the quantum origins of the generated EUV light [Torretti, Nature Comms. Nature Commun. <strong>11</strong>, (2020)], found a universal law for expanding plasma [Sheil, Phys. Rev. Lett. <strong>133</strong>, (2024)], and found that less than half the initial droplet volume is present on thin tin sheet targets as used in EUV sources [Liu, Phys. Rev. Appl. <strong>20</strong>, (2023)], and work on an alternative EUV source solution [Mostafa, Appl. Phys. Lett. <strong>123</strong>, (2023)].<br><br><strong>Background</strong><br>The revolutionary introduction of EUV lithography was the culmination of several decades of collaborative work between industry and science – a Project Apollo of the digital age. The short, 13.5-nm EUV wavelength enables patterning the smallest, smartest, and most energy-efficient features on chips. The required 13.5-nm radiation is generated from plasma that is produced from tiny tin droplets that are heated by powerful laser pulses. At ARCNL, we are now thinking about the next generation of light sources: Can we make more efficient and more powerful EUV sources? Is it possible to make light sources that emit radiation efficiently at even shorter wavelengths?<br><br><strong>Project goal</strong><br>To identify what light source will power the next generation of lithography machines, we need to understand what plasma conditions are optimal for producing light from plasma, but also we need to understand how such plasma should be generated, and what laser technology should be used.

      "description_en": "Would you like to investigate the underlying behavioral phenomenon for innovative designs of mixed fixed-flexible transport networks?\nJob description\nThe increase of public transport usage has clear potential in transforming our environment to be more liveable, sustainable and convenient. However, to ensure economic viability with off-peak times and relatively remote locations, while increasing the attractiveness to the users, we need innovative designs where fixed and flexible services support each other. This necessitates a multidisciplinary approach bringing together optimization, machine learning and behavioral modeling methodologies.\nIn FlexMobility we propose a holistic approach to design a public transport network that includes both traditional fixed lines and flexible on-demand services, while considering the underlying travel behaviour. To reach a user-centric public transport system we will also study how the demand would react to such a mixed system. We will do so by combining revealed preferences data on the already available systems together with stated preferences in tailored surveys for enriching the understanding of the mixed system. The behavioural understanding on the demand side will provide information to the supply side, such as the trade-offs between different attributes of the system, or the acceptable walking and waiting times, which will be used both to adapt the design and to have more realistic simulations. Supply and demand levels are intimately intertwined. While the chosen design has a significant effect on the most important aspects of users’ experience, the algorithms,\nand thus the supply decisions, are based on users’ preferences.\nThis PhD position within FlexMobility, will focus on the supply-demand interactions to guide the design of mixed fixed-flexible transport networks. This will start with the behavioral investigation based on the available data as well as the new survey data to be collected. The purpose of this first step will be to identify the key attributes of the transport system that influence the preferences of the users while accounting for the behavioral heterogeneity in the population. Methodologically, we might explore both random utility models as well as machine learning, potentially in a hybrid way, in onder to capture complex phenomenon. The behavioral understanding will guide the representation of supply-demand interactions in the next step. A baseline methodology will be an iterative process between supply and demand models, which will then be expanded towards endogenous representation of behavioral models in the network design problem. This integration of supply-demand interaction will build on optimization models of the transport network and will be enhanced with the behavioral representations. The decisions to be optimized could potentially exploit model-based learning approaches.\nIn this work, we will consider two use cases: (1) bus network considering both fixed-line buses and on-demand ones (2) a network with water-taxis which operate in fixed and flexible modes at different times of the day. For both use cases, there will be interaction with the project partners for generating/obtaining the needed data as well as for setting up realistic case studies.\nThe position is available as of October 1, 2025 with a flexible start date to be agreed upon. The PhD candidate will join the group of Bilge Atasoy, with various researchers working on adaptive transport and logistics systems through methodologies of dynamic and predictive optimization, behavioral modeling and machine learning. There is vivid interaction within the group to foster collaboration both with scientific and social activities. The PhD candidate will also interact with the group of Javier Alonso-Mora as part of the FlexMobility project as there will be in total 2 PhDs and 1 postdoctoral researcher working in a collaborative way to reach the goal of designing user-centric flexible transport networks. As part of the PhD position, there will be opportunities to gain teaching experience in the relevant courses and/or supervising MSc students.\nTU Delft (Delft University of Technology)\nDelft University of Technology is built on strong foundations.

        "description": "<em><strong>Would you like to investigate the underlying behavioral phenomenon for innovative designs of mixed fixed-flexible transport networks?</strong></em><br><br><strong>Job description</strong><br>The increase of public transport usage has clear potential in transforming our environment to be more liveable, sustainable and convenient. However, to ensure economic viability with off-peak times and relatively remote locations, while increasing the attractiveness to the users, we need innovative designs where fixed and flexible services support each other. This necessitates a multidisciplinary approach bringing together optimization, machine learning and behavioral modeling methodologies.<br><br>In FlexMobility we propose a holistic approach to design a public transport network that includes both traditional fixed lines and flexible on-demand services, while considering the underlying travel behaviour. To reach a user-centric public transport system we will also study how the demand would react to such a mixed system. We will do so by combining revealed preferences data on the already available systems together with stated preferences in tailored surveys for enriching the understanding of the mixed system. The behavioural understanding on the demand side will provide information to the supply side, such as the trade-offs between different attributes of the system, or the acceptable walking and waiting times, which will be used both to adapt the design and to have more realistic simulations. Supply and demand levels are intimately intertwined. While the chosen design has a significant effect on the most important aspects of users’ experience, the algorithms,<br><br>and thus the supply decisions, are based on users’ preferences.<br><br>This PhD position within FlexMobility, will focus on the supply-demand interactions to guide the design of mixed fixed-flexible transport networks. This will start with the behavioral investigation based on the available data as well as the new survey data to be collected. The purpose of this first step will be to identify the key attributes of the transport system that influence the preferences of the users while accounting for the behavioral heterogeneity in the population. Methodologically, we might explore both random utility models as well as machine learning, potentially in a hybrid way, in onder to capture complex phenomenon. The behavioral understanding will guide the representation of supply-demand interactions in the next step. A baseline methodology will be an iterative process between supply and demand models, which will then be expanded towards endogenous representation of behavioral models in the network design problem. This integration of supply-demand interaction will build on optimization models of the transport network and will be enhanced with the behavioral representations. The decisions to be optimized could potentially exploit model-based learning approaches.<br><br>In this work, we will consider two use cases: (1) bus network considering both fixed-line buses and on-demand ones (2) a network with water-taxis which operate in fixed and flexible modes at different times of the day. For both use cases, there will be interaction with the project partners for generating/obtaining the needed data as well as for setting up realistic case studies.<br><br>The position is available as of October 1, 2025 with a flexible start date to be agreed upon. The PhD candidate will join the group of Bilge Atasoy, with various researchers working on adaptive transport and logistics systems through methodologies of dynamic and predictive optimization, behavioral modeling and machine learning. There is vivid interaction within the group to foster collaboration both with scientific and social activities. The PhD candidate will also interact with the group of Javier Alonso-Mora as part of the FlexMobility project as there will be in total 2 PhDs and 1 postdoctoral researcher working in a collaborative way to reach the goal of designing user-centric flexible transport networks. As part of the PhD position, there will be opportunities to gain teaching experience in the relevant courses and/or supervising MSc students.<br><br><strong>Job requirements</strong><br>We are looking for a candidate with transportation research knowledge who is comfortable with operations research methodologies as well as behavioral modeling.

Passionate about archival research and oral history? Self-motivated and ready to learn new research skills?\nThe Department of History is looking for two PhD candidates to undertake archival and oral history research on women’s migration and work. You will be part of a new European Research Council-funded project entitled FeMMiWork: Women Migrants from the Northern Mediterranean and Work in Postwar Northwestern Europe.\nUsing a transnational lens that takes migrants’ countries both of origin and residence into account, FeMMiWork investigates the experiences of women who migrated from Italy, Yugoslavia, and Turkey to France and Germany in the 1950s-1970s and who engaged in paid work. In spite of their large numbers, their labour has been largely erased by policymakers and forgotten by researchers who focused on male labour migration. Drawing on archival sources and oral history, the project aims to understand what role paid work played in migrant women’s life trajectories, and in shaping relations with their communities of origin and destination. The project also aims to make the histories of these women visible by creating a ‘counter-archive’ using documents, oral histories, and creative writing.\nTwo PhDs are sought, one to document the trajectories of women from Italy, and one to do so for women from Turkey. Each PhD will be researching women who moved to Germany and to France. There is room, within this framework, to shape the PhD project in line with your own interests. You will be part of a collaborative and interdisciplinary team examining commonalities and differences across countries of origin (Italy, Turkey, and Yugoslavia) and destination countries (France and Germany). The team consists of the Principal Investigator (PI), Dr. Brigitte Le Normand, one postdoctoral researcher, a project manager, an ICT consultant, and two PhDs. The PI will research the case of women from Yugoslavia. The PI and post-doctoral researcher will additionally support the PhDs by carrying out research in French and German archives. The team will jointly address the project’s larger conceptual questions through reading groups, workshops, and collaborative writing projects.\nThe tasks include:\n- Developing a research plan, taking into consideration ethics and data management procedures of the Faculty;\n- Literature review of published sources including Italian or Turkish language, as relevant;\n- Archival research and oral history focused on the experiences of women migrants;\n- Participating in the development of a counter-archive of migrant working women;\n- Writing a doctoral dissertation and (co)authoring publications (e.g. peer-reviewed journal articles);\n- Participating in group meetings and contributing to the organization of events and workshops;\n- Presenting work-in-progress at international workshops, conference panels and to colleagues within the Faculty.\nIn this role you will learn to synthesize archival research and oral history while developing your writing and teamwork skills. Further trainings will be provided through the university Graduate School.\nThe position also includes 0.2 FTE teaching, which will allow you to develop your teaching skills and credentials.\nWhat we offer\nAs PhD candidate\nat Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences\n, you will be employed by the most international university in the Netherlands, located in the beautiful city of Maastricht.

Passionate about archival research and oral history? Self-motivated and ready to learn new research skills? </em><br><br>The Department of History is looking for two PhD candidates to undertake archival and oral history research on women’s migration and work. You will be part of a new European Research Council-funded project entitled FeMMiWork: Women Migrants from the Northern Mediterranean and Work in Postwar Northwestern Europe.<br><br>Using a transnational lens that takes migrants’ countries both of origin and residence into account, FeMMiWork investigates the experiences of women who migrated from Italy, Yugoslavia, and Turkey to France and Germany in the 1950s-1970s and who engaged in paid work. In spite of their large numbers, their labour has been largely erased by policymakers and forgotten by researchers who focused on male labour migration. Drawing on archival sources and oral history, the project aims to understand what role paid work played in migrant women’s life trajectories, and in shaping relations with their communities of origin and destination. The project also aims to make the histories of these women visible by creating a ‘counter-archive’ using documents, oral histories, and creative writing.<br><br>Two PhDs are sought, one to document the trajectories of women from Italy, and one to do so for women from Turkey. Each PhD will be researching women who moved to Germany and to France. There is room, within this framework, to shape the PhD project in line with your own interests. You will be part of a collaborative and interdisciplinary team examining commonalities and differences across countries of origin (Italy, Turkey, and Yugoslavia) and destination countries (France and Germany). The team consists of the Principal Investigator (PI), Dr. Brigitte Le Normand, one postdoctoral researcher, a project manager, an ICT consultant, and two PhDs. The PI will research the case of women from Yugoslavia. The PI and post-doctoral researcher will additionally support the PhDs by carrying out research in French and German archives.

The group has experience in teaching and conducting high quality research on consumer behaviour in NPD, consumers' perceptions of new product designs, and on improving the acceptance of new sustainable alternatives. By enhancing knowledge in these areas, we aim to help designers create more successful and sustainable product and services.\nA Circular Economy requires changes in consumer behaviour, such as adopting repair practices and purchasing refurbished products. However, consumers face barriers to adopting such circular behaviours. For repair, challenges include time, effort, lack of knowledge, high costs, availability of spare parts and perceived low product value. Repair and refurbishments are also met with scepticism, as consumers often associate it with lower quality and wear. As a result, repair is rarely considered, and refurbishment occupies a small share of the consumer market.\nThis PhD project will explore how AM can increase consumer adoption of repair and refurbishment, as AM offers unique opportunities for customization, fast and cost-effective repairs and enhanced product value. However, consumer perceptions of AM in repair and refurbishment contexts remain unclear, as does their likelihood of adopting these solutions based on product design integration. Accordingly, this PhD project aims to answer the following research questions:\n1) What motivators and barriers do consumers experience regarding AM-based repair and remanufacturing? and 2) Which design strategies will increase consumer adoption of AM-based repair and remanufacturing?\nTo answer these research questions, we expect to use a mixed-method approach, including both consumer research (qualitative and quantitative) and Research-through-Design (RtD).\nThis PhD project will be part of a larger, NWO-funded project on Additive Manufacturing in repair and remanufacturing (called ADD-ReAM), which includes, in total, 15 PhDs who focus on other aspects such as technical design aspects, logistics, sustainability assessment, consumer behaviour, and more.\nTU Delft (Delft University of Technology)\nDelft University of Technology is built on strong foundations. As creators of the world-famous Dutch waterworks and pioneers in biotech, TU Delft is a top international university combining science, engineering and design.

Your project will focus on developing new methods to understand how genetic variants affect not only individual brain cells but also change the way cells interact and communicate — insights that are essential for understanding the cellular origins of brain disorders.\nDespite major progress in genetics research, we still don’t know how genetic risk factors for brain disorders like schizophrenia, alzheimer, and depression disrupt brain function. Genetic discoveries point to thousands of disease-associated SNPs, but most of them act in subtle and cell type–specific ways, and their downstream biological effects remain poorly understood.\nThis project tackles this fundamental gap — by building computational models that simulate what goes wrong in the brain, one cell (and one cell–cell interaction) at a time.\nYou will work with large-scale single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data to develop and apply single-cell foundation models — generative machine learning models that represent the structure and variation of cell states. These models act as virtual cells simulating how perturbing the expression of genes altered by genetic variants affects the cell’s identity, behavior, and trajectory. You will extend these models to understand how genetic risk factors alter cell–cell communication networks. Spatial transcriptomics datasets will be used to anchor these models in real tissue context, revealing how spatially organized cell communities rewire under genetic perturbation.\nKey challenges\n- Use and improve single-cell foundation models to predict SNP-driven shifts in cell state and cell fate.\n- Integrate spatial transcriptomics data to anchor these predictions in tissue context.\n- Develop machine learning methods (e.g. graph neural networks, variational or diffusion models) to model cell–cell communication dynamics under genetic perturbation.\n- Investigate how local interactions between perturbed and unperturbed cells reshape signaling networks and tissue states.\n- Closely collobarate with neuroscientists in the BRAINSCAPES consortium to link model predictions to experimental and clinical relevance.\nBenefits\n- Shape next-generation models for understanding brain disease mechanisms.\n- Work in a collaborative, interdisciplinary, and dynamic environment with leading experts in machine learning, computational biology, and neurogenomics.\n- Access cutting-edge datasets, infrastructure, and computational and experimental facilities.\n- Receive support for professional development and participation in international conferences.\nTU Delft (Delft University of Technology)\nDelft University of Technology is built on strong foundations. As creators of the world-famous Dutch waterworks and pioneers in biotech, TU Delft is a top international university combining science, engineering and design. It delivers world class results in education, research and innovation to address challenges in the areas of energy, climate, mobility, health and digital society. For generations, our engineers have proven to be entrepreneurial problem-solvers, both in business and in a social context.\nAt TU Delft we embrace diversity as one of our core\nvalues\nand we actively\nengage\nto be a university where you feel at home and can flourish.

Impact!\nFaculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science\nThe Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science (EEMCS) brings together three scientific disciplines. Combined, they reinforce each other and are the driving force behind the technology we all use in our daily lives. Technology such as the electricity grid, which our faculty is helping to make completely sustainable and future-proof. At the same time, we are developing the chips and sensors of the future, whilst also setting the foundations for the software technologies to run on this new generation of equipment – which of course includes AI. Meanwhile we are pushing the limits of applied mathematics, for example mapping out disease processes using single cell data, and using mathematics to simulate gigantic ash plumes after a volcanic eruption. In other words: there is plenty of room at the faculty for ground-breaking research. We educate innovative engineers and have excellent labs and facilities that underline our strong international position.

While genetic discovery studies have provided unprecedented insight into the genes associated with these disorders, the critical next step is to translate this knowledge into mechanistic understanding. BRAINSCAPES develops innovative analytical and experimental approaches to investigate how risk genes affect the function of specific cell types, neural circuits, and ultimately behavior. By uncovering the molecular and cellular basis of complex brain disorders, the program aims to pave the way for the development of novel, targeted treatments.

      "description_en": "Background\nEnergy systems are undergoing rapid changes, both in terms of electrical power generation, but also in the fast transition taking place in other energy-intensive sectors such as heating of buildings. This presents many opportunities, but also requires careful planning and operation to deal with emerging challenges such as network congestion. Recently, positive energy districts (PEDs), i.e. communities of homes that have very low or net-zero greenhouse gas emission and are highly energy-efficient, have become a key component of the energy transition.\nThe EmPowerEd project is a large national project that focuses on tackling the challenges that PEDs face in the transition to carbon-neutral heating. It is a large project, bringing together several Dutch universities, companies and municipalities to address this key societal challenges. It is also highly interdisciplinary, bringing together expertise ranging from mechanical and electrical engineering, computer science, built environment, to social sciences, economics and regulation.\nJob description\nThe project of the PhD student based at CWI in Amsterdam will focus on techno-economic models (and in particular multi-agent modeling) of energy exchange and flexibility for positive energy districts. A specific focus will be placed on designing incentives and sharing models between prosumers in PEDs. This includes both peer-peer trading models between individual prosumers (based on their own energy assets such as PVs, home batteries, heat pumps etc.), and models where joint electricity and heating infrastructure is shared in a local cooperative or coalition.\nPotential topics that are relevant for this PhD position include:\n- Modeling of peer-peer energy exchanges between prosumers in energy communities, considering their energy preferences and constraints\n- Coalitional models for efficient sharing of joint energy infrastructure (such as a community heating network or community battery).

      "description_en": "Word jij de onderzoeker die de verborgen rijkdom van Nederlandse buitenplaatsen in kaart brengt? Verbind erfgoed, landschap en data in een uniek promotieproject.\nFunctieomschrijving\nNederland kent nog altijd veel historische buitenplaatsen, kastelen en landgoederen, die diep verweven zijn met het landschap. Deze buitenplaatslandschappen vormen unieke culturele, landschappelijke en ecologische systemen, maar hun toekomst staat onder druk door klimaatverandering, verstedelijking en veranderend gebruik.\nOm dit waardevolle erfgoed te behouden en toekomstbestendig te maken, is overzicht en actuele kennis onmisbaar. Hoe kun je immers beschermen wat je niet kent? Daarom slaan de TU Delft en de Vereniging Particuliere Historische Buitenplaatsen (VPHB) de handen ineen voor de Landelijke Inventarisatie Particuliere Historische Buitenplaatsen: een promotieonderzoek dat een compleet en gedetailleerd overzicht ontwikkelt van particuliere complex historische buitenplaatsen en informatie samenbrengt over hun ruimtelijke opbouw en gebruik.\nHet onderzoek start met de circa 200 buitenplaatsen binnen de VPHB en wordt later uitgebreid naar buitenplaatsen in de rest van Nederland. Deze zijn zorgvuldig ontworpen ensembles van gebouwen, tuinen en groenstructuren. Ze bestaan doorgaans uit een (voormalig) versterkt huis, kasteel, buiten- of landhuis met bijgebouwen, omgeven door tuinen, grachten, lanen, parken, (sier)weiden, waterpartijen en moestuinen. Samen vormen deze onderdelen een historisch gegroeid geheel waarin de wisselwerking tussen cultuur, natuur en ontwerp centraal staat.\nAls promovendus speel jij een sleutelrol in dit project. Je brengt particuliere buitenplaatsen systematisch in kaart en bouwt aan een GIS-gebaseerde digitale database die inzicht biedt in ligging, gebruik, eigendom en ruimtelijke structuur. Hiervoor ontwikkel je een enquête die via persoonlijke interviews met particuliere eigenaren wordt afgenomen. De verkregen informatie vormt de basis voor de database, die je structureert, analyseert en visualiseert. Daarbij besteed je bijzondere aandacht aan de individuele buitenplaats, de historische groenaanleg en de manier waarop deze binnen bredere buitenplaatslandschappen functioneren.\nNaast dit empirische werk ontwikkel je een wetenschappelijke methode en theoretisch kader voor het analyseren en representeren van buitenplaatslandschappen. Je onderzoekt hoe digitale kartering, data-integratie en landschapsanalyse kunnen bijdragen aan het behoud, beheer en toekomstgerichte ontwikkeling van dit particuliere erfgoed.\nHet project vindt plaats in nauwe samenwerking met de VPHB, die toegang biedt tot een groot netwerk van particuliere eigenaren en buitenplaatsen. Je werkt binnen een interdisciplinair team met expertise in landschapsarchitectuur, cultuurgeschiedenis en erfgoedbeheer, verbonden aan de TU Delft, de Rijksuniversiteit Groningen en de Radboud Universiteit.\nBinnen deze context krijg je ruimte voor eigen initiatief, verdieping en samenwerking. Je draagt bij aan de ontwikkeling van een digitale kennisinfrastructuur die niet alleen wetenschappelijke inzichten oplevert, maar ook praktische waarde heeft voor beleid, beheer en toekomstig onderzoek.\nTot je werkzaamheden behoren het ontwikkelen van een methodologie voor dataverzameling, kartering en analyse, en het ontwerpen en uitvoeren van een enquête die via persoonlijke interviews met particuliere eigenaren wordt afgenomen. Je bouwt en beheert een GIS-database met ruimtelijke en beschrijvende gegevens, voert analyses en visualisaties uit, en vertaalt de resultaten naar wetenschappelijke publicaties en je proefschrift. Daarnaast presenteer je bevindingen aan academische en maatschappelijke partners en draag je actief bij aan kennisdeling binnen de VPHB en aan een publieksgerichte digitale kaart.\nJe maakt deel uit van de Sectie Landschapsarchitectuur, met een sterke onderzoekstraditie in buitenplaatsen en innovatieve technologie. In deze internationale omgeving versterken landschapsarchitectuur, erfgoed en technologie elkaar, en draag jij bij aan inzicht in hoe particuliere buitenplaatsen functioneren en duurzaam kunnen worden beheerd .\nFunctie-eisen\n- Achtergrond in een relavant domein zoals landschapsarchitectuur, erfgoedstudies, geografie, planologie, landschapsgeschiedenis of een verwante discipline.\n- Ervaring met ruimtelijke analyse, databewerking en/of erfgoedonderzoek.\n- Interesse in de relatie tussen landschap, erfgoed en eigendom, en in de rol van particuliere buitenplaatsen in ruimtelijke kwaliteit en beleid.\n- Vaardig met GIS (bijv. ArcGIS, QGIS) en databases.\n- Goede communicatieve vaardigheden en gevoelig voor menselijke en institutionele relaties.\n- Bekend met wetenschappelijke methoden voor dataverzameling en analyse, en bij voorkeur met interviewtechnieken, cartografische visualisatie of landschapsanalyse.\n- In staat om samen te werken in een interdisciplinair team, initiatief te nemen en resultaatgericht te werken.\n- Uitstekende beheersing van de Nederlandse taal (mondeling en schriftelijk) en goede kennis van het Engels.\nTU Delft\nDe Technische Universiteit Delft heeft een sterk fundament. Als bouwer van de wereldberoemde Nederlandse waterwerken en pionier in biotech is TU Delft een internationale topuniversiteit die wetenschap, engineering en design combineert. TU Delft staat voor onderwijs, onderzoek en innovatie van wereldklasse om uitdagingen op het gebied van energie, klimaat, mobiliteit, gezondheid en digitale maatschappij aan te gaan. Generaties Delftse ingenieurs hebben bewezen ondernemende probleemoplossers te zijn in bedrijfsleven en in sociale context.\nBij TU Delft omarmen we diversiteit als een van onze\nkernwaarden\nen\nzetten we ons actief in\nom een universiteit te zijn waar jij je thuis voelt en kunt floreren. We hechten veel waarde aan verschillende perspectieven en kwaliteiten, omdat wij geloven dat dit ons werk innovatiever, de TU Delft-gemeenschap levendiger en de wereld rechtvaardiger maakt.

You will play a pivotal role in\nADD-reAM\n(‘Additive Repair and Remanufacturing’), a cutting-edge NWA ORC-funded project that embeds repair and remanufacturing at the heart of future European industrial strategy — supporting the EU’s ambitions for circularity, resilience, and decarbonisation. The project brings together leading academic and industrial partners across Europe, including CML at Leiden University. ADD-reAM unites universities, research institutes, and industry leaders to ensure that the next generation of additive manufacturing technologies enables repair and reuse by design, strengthening the EU’s circular manufacturing vision.\nIn this role, you will\ndevelop and operationalise the Safe and Sustainable-by-Design (SSbD)\nframework specifically for\nadditive manufacturing (AM) repair and remanufacturing\n, helping to shift AM beyond prototyping and custom parts into sustainable, circular production systems.\nYour work will:\n- Tailor existing SSbD frameworks and models to the particular technical and environmental challenges of AM repair and remanufacturing , establishing clear system boundaries and decision criteria that reflect the realities of metallic additive repair, polymer-based refurbishment, and hybrid manufacturing workflows.\nAM repair and remanufacturing\n- Push the state of the art in prospective (ex-ante) LCA and Social-LCA (S-LCA) by combining empirical industrial-scale data with modeled scale-up scenarios. You’ll address process variability, material reuse, energy-demand uncertainties, and supply-chain social impacts — crucial for projecting future performance of AM in circular settings.\nprospective (ex-ante) LCA\nSocial-LCA (S-LCA)\n- Fuse environmental, social, and safety dimensions into a unified decision-support structure using Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) and multi-objective optimisation , revealing robust trade-offs and Pareto-efficient strategies for sustainable AM repair choices.\nMulti-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)\nmulti-objective optimisation\n- Collaborate intensively with project partners to validate your framework on real-world industrial case studies — delivering open-source workflow tools, harmonised datasets, and transparent pipelines that guide safe, socially responsible deployment of AM in circular value chains.\nYour research will cut across\nindustrial ecology\n,\nsustainability analytics\n, and\ndecision science\n, and will directly contribute to shaping Europe’s transition toward\ncircular, resilient manufacturing systems\n. The expected start date is February 2026 (or as soon as possible thereafter).\nWhere you will work\nLeiden University is situated between Amsterdam (36 km) and The Hague (15 km) and was founded in 1575, making it the oldest university in the Netherlands. It houses around 35,000 students originating from 112 nationalities, facilitated by approximately 8,000 staff.\nThe Institute of Environmental Science (CML) at Leiden University offers a vibrant and supportive community of scientists committed to the challenges of sustainability.

You will perform experiments, develop dose-response models and mechanistic understanding allowing to develop a workflow allowing understanding and awareness amongst different stakeholders. You will be embedded in the Environmental Biology Department, which is part of the Institute for Environmental Sciences at the Faculty of Science at Leiden University.\nDescription of research:\nThe application of nanotechnology in medicine, provides tremendous opportunities either to improve existing therapies or enable entirely new treatments for a range of debilitating diseases, including cancer and genetic disorders. Especially in the field of drug delivery, nanomedicines (NM) have shown effectiveness by increasing the therapeutic index of existing drugs or enabling macromolecular drugs to overcome biological barriers. Despite these success stories, there are still quite some roadblocks that limit the full potential and breadth of NM in treating a variety of diseases. From the perspective of (eco)toxicology we are talking mainly about substances that are problematic in light of their poor degradability, high toxicity or tendency to accumulate at non-targeted sites. The Environmental Risk Assessment framework developed within our group gives tools to determine exposure as well as potential effects, allowing risk characterization.\nThe PhD project is part of a national effort (NanoMedNL) to create novel nanomedicines for the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of patients. The PhD student will collaborate with and contribute to this multidisciplinary consortium.\nWhat you will do\nWe will establish a workflow for the investigation of the release and potential short-term and long-term impacts of nanomedicines and their degradation products on a representative battery of non-target species (e.g. culturable microbes from a representative host, some standard low tier laboratory species like daphnids, algae). Experiments on fate within the relevant exposure medium, as well as uptake and effects will be executed. The assessment will follow a tiered approach adding realism and complexity into the testing: from standard OECD lab tests to disentanglement of mechanisms of toxicity including biotransformation and degradation of nanomedicines towards a quantitative assessment with more complex testing, enhancing the human and ecological relevance. This tiered approach gives support to environmental risk assessment for these new classes of medicines from the design phase onwards. It should integrate awareness and risk-benefit considerations.\nKey responsibilities\n- Complete a PhD thesis within the official appointment duration of four year\nComplete a PhD thesis within the official appointment duration of four year\n- Investigate novel nano-embedded carriers of medicines and publish about dose-effect relationships and mechanisms of uptake, biodistribution and effects.\nInvestigate novel nano-embedded carriers of medicines and publish about dose-effect relationships and mechanisms of uptake, biodistribution and effects.\n- Collaborate with a variety of stakeholders, so that together standardized workflows and understanding can be established.\nCollaborate with a variety of stakeholders, so that together standardized workflows and understanding can be established.\n- Discuss your work in our group meetings, incorporate feedback, and give input to others\nDiscuss your work in our group meetings, incorporate feedback, and give input to others\n- Assist in writing the deliverable of the tiered approach for the determination of nanomedicine environmental impact based on your scientific achievements.\nAssist in writing the deliverable\nof the tiered approach for the determination of nanomedicine environmental impact based on your scientific achievements.\nWhere you will work\nLeiden University is situated between Amsterdam (36 km) and The Hague (15 km) and was founded in 1575, making it the oldest university in the Netherlands.

Especially in the field of drug delivery, nanomedicines (NM) have shown effectiveness by increasing the therapeutic index of existing drugs or enabling macromolecular drugs to overcome biological barriers. Despite these success stories, there are still quite some roadblocks that limit the full potential and breadth of NM in treating a variety of diseases. From the perspective of (eco)toxicology we are talking mainly about substances that are problematic in light of their poor degradability, high toxicity or tendency to accumulate at non-targeted sites. The Environmental Risk Assessment framework developed within our group gives tools to determine exposure as well as potential effects, allowing risk characterization.<br><br>The PhD project is part of a national effort (NanoMedNL) to create novel nanomedicines for the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of patients.

Experiments on fate within the relevant exposure medium, as well as uptake and effects will be executed. The assessment will follow a tiered approach adding realism and complexity into the testing: from standard OECD lab tests to disentanglement of mechanisms of toxicity including biotransformation and degradation of nanomedicines towards a quantitative assessment with more complex testing, enhancing the human and ecological relevance. This tiered approach gives support to environmental risk assessment for these new classes of medicines from the design phase onwards.

Determine what is needed to build a strong co-creation approach that brings together different types of expertise. Map out the interests, needs, and expectations of various stakeholders. Identify when and how stakeholders should be involved, and which strategies and methods to use. Together with DC4, develop clear protocols that outline these strategies and methods, including specific actions and procedures to follow in the project.</li> <li>Create tailored co-creation tools for the FOG and RHD use cases. These tools will support the DCs in developing the project framework, collecting and curating data, and designing FMs and care pathways—all using a participatory, stakeholder-driven approach supported by the Co-Creation Council. Help guide and support the use of these tools throughout the project to maintain an inclusive co-creation process.</li> <li>Make sure the co-creation strategies, methods, and tools are embedded in the development of FM-based applications (in collaboration with DC5, 6, 7, and 8) and in the creation of ethical and legal self-assessment tools (developed by DC1 and 2). Also ensure these co-creation elements are integrated into the project's pilot actions.</li> <li>Identify what is needed to transfer the framework and other project results to other healthcare contexts. Work with DC5, 6, 7, and 8 to define these transfer conditions, and with DC1, 2, and 4 to develop policy recommendations.

The candidate will be part of an international network of top universities and renowned scholars within the field, supervised by Prof. Gaby Odekerken-Schroeder and Prof. Dominik Mahr.\nYour colleagues:\nAI and robots can do a lot of good in healthcare, but only if they are built with the people who use and are affected by it: patients, nurses, doctors, data teams, and communities. This PhD focuses on the skills those people need to work well together (listening, facilitation, ethics, data basics, cultural sensitivity) so that AI is fair, safe, and useful in both high-resource and low-resource settings around the world.\nYou will map where co-creation breaks down today and why, identify the essential skills different stakeholders need, and design training that works in practice (from simple workshop tools to digital and VR exercises). Together with a sister PhD (DC3), you’ll help create an online learning community and clear protocols so healthcare organisations and partners can apply co-creation consistently across projects and contexts.\nThis is an academic, hands-on, international project. You will co-design, test, and improve the training with real users, then evaluate what people learn and how it changes outcomes. You’ll also translate results into practical recommendations for healthcare managers and policymakers. Affiliated with the Department of Marketing & Supply Chain Management (\nMSCM\n), the candidate will have access to excellent resources and state-of-the-art digital lab facilities like the\nSBE DEXlab\nand the Maastricht Center for Robots (\nMCR\n).\nWhat you do – specific research objectives\n- Identify gaps and obstacles caused by a lack of co-creation skills that hinder the recognition of the public value of social justice in AI for healthcare, both locally and globally. Identify the essential co-creation skills needed for integrating the expertise and backgrounds of stakeholders in the healthcare ecosystem, in both the Global North and the Global South. Determine the most suitable training strategies and content to enhance these skills. In collaboration with DC3, develop protocols that define a set of strategies and methods to build co-creation skills, to be implemented throughout the project in support of a robust co-creation approach.\n- Develop training strategies, methods, content, and materials tailored to the healthcare ecosystem in both the Global North and Global South, aimed at strengthening co-creation capabilities. Establish an online platform that incorporates cutting-edge digital technologies to facilitate communication and learning among a global community of stakeholders. In collaboration with DC3, explore how this learning community can foster the development of co-creation processes and skills in the challenging global context.\n- Open the above-mentioned platform to all stakeholders involved in the pilot actions, both in the West and the Global South. Test and validate the training strategies, methods, content, and materials by delivering targeted training initiatives to pilot participants. Validation will include collecting action reviews after the training and assessing learning outcomes and proficiency levels among DCs and stakeholders.\n- Support the identification of conditions for the transferability of the Framework and other project outputs by identifying the co-creation skills required for application in other healthcare contexts. Develop recommendations for decision-makers and policy-makers that emphasize the critical role of co-creation skills. All in collaboration with other projects.\nExpected results:\n- Defined set of co-creation skills for the global healthcare innovation ecosystem\n- Establishment of a learning community to foster continuous exchange and development\n- Blended training approach, combining non-digital and digital methods\n- Use of state-of-the-art training tools, including online communities and virtual reality environments\nIndicative planned secondments -\nInstitution, place and timing\n- Altuïtion BV ('s-Hertogenbosch, Netherlands); Nov. – Dec. 2026\n- University of Cape Town (Cape Town, South Africa); Feb. – Apr. 2027; Apr. – May 2028\n- Path Check Inc (Cambridge, USA); Mar. – Apr. 2029\nFurther analysis might be required, based on the development of a research project.\nWhat you bring\nWe seek candidates who are driven by a genuine passion for academic research and aspire to contribute to the research project’s topics.\n- Exhibit a strong research orientation and academic motivation\n- Hold a Master’s degree (preferably 120 ECTS)\n- Show familiarity with research methods\n- Demonstrate proficiency in the English language\nMarie Curie mobility rules do apply\n:\ncandidates should not have worked or studied in the host country for more than 12 months in the last three years.\nDesirable requirements:\n- Prior experience with quantitative and/or qualitative research methods; familiarity with software such as R, Python, SPSS, or NVivo is a plus\n- Strong motivation for pursuing an academic career, with the intention to publish in international peer-reviewed journals\n- Ability to work independently while also being a collaborative team player in a diverse and international environment\n- Willingness to engage with industry partners, research institutes and interdisciplinary initiatives\nSelection criteria:\nAll eligible applications will be assessed by a Selection panel according to the following criterion “Qualifications and previous experience” and related sub-criteria with equal weight:\n- Qualifications and previous experience (50,0 point score)\nQuality of academic performance , Current knowledge and expertise, Relevant research skills, Motivation to apply, Good command of Dutch.\n- Communication and Personal skills (0-70,0 point score)\nAbility to design and conduct original research in the subject area of the individual research project, Excellent oral communication in English, Enthusiasm, proactivity, creativity and commitment, Interpersonal skills, Attitude to team working and in working in local and international setting, Expected impact of the doctorate on the DC’s future career, Ability to interact with Dutch speaking people.\nWhat we offer\nAs PhD Candidate co-creation skills for decolonized, just and trustworthy ai in healthcare\nat School of Business and Economics\n, you will be employed by the most international university in the Netherlands, located in the beautiful city of Maastricht.

      "description_en": "The PhD will develop AI methods and approaches to enable accurate characterization of metal scrap, for more efficient metal recovery and recycling\nJob description\nThe volume of available metal scrap is steadily increasing, driven by rising end-of-life products, recycling opportunities, and growing industrial turnover. As this secondary resource becomes more abundant and diverse, it presents both a challenge and a strategic opportunity for circular metallurgy. Efficient and advanced recycling of scrap is critical to meet the growing demand for metals in a resource-constrained world and reduce their environmental footprint.In this context, the optimization of material recovery from end-of-life vehicle scrap is challenged not only by the heterogeneous and evolving nature of this scrap, but also by the diverse operational constraints and economic motivations across the value chain.\nTo address these challenges, the project will develop multi-modal artificial intelligence methods to characterize metal scrap composition with unprecedented detail, enabling dynamic, data-driven insight into the recoverable value of materials. Agentic AI systems will be designed to autonomously explore and propose optimal dismantling, sorting, and processing routes tailored to specific scrap streams. These intelligent agents will integrate scrap data and industry constraints to recommend strategies that maximize resource recovery and economic return. Together, these AI-driven tools will serve as a foundation for decision-making platforms that guide industry stakeholders toward more efficient, profitable, and sustainable recycling practices across the circular steel ecosystem.\nThis PhD position is part of the Groeien met Groen Staal program from the Dutch national growth fund (https://groeienmetgroenstaal.nl). The Groein met Groen Staal program is the enabler of a revolution in green steel production at national and international arenas. It will develop solutions to overcome technical, economic and societal bottlenecks towards the following overarching goals: i) Making Dutch steel sector a leader in sustainable steel; ii) Quadrupling of scrap sorting activities; iii) Tripling of steel reuse and remanufacturing activities; iv) Reducing dependence on foreign steel/iron ore through scrap recycling; v) Reducing industry CO2 emissions by 30% and reduce other emissions (including nitrogen oxides and particulate matter) by 50%.\nThe project contributes to reaching this overarching objective by enabling increased: i) cost/energy efficiency in recycling/recovery of metals from scrap, ii) scrap value, iii) recycled scrap amounts, iv) amounts of recovered critical elements.\nThis PhD position is also part of the interdisciplinary Climate Safety & Security centre (CaSS) at TU Delft | Campus The Hague. This centre runs an ambitious and comprehensive programme that considers climate change and stability in an integrated manner, with focus on human security, security of supply of fundamental needs (water, food) and essential resources (energy, critical materials). The PhD will contribute to the flagship materials security within CaSS. The successful candidate will have the opportunity to collaborate with researchers from across TU Delft, as well as policy makers from (inter)national governments and organisations in The Hague and beyond.\nFor more information on the TU Delft | Climate Safety & Security centre see:\nwww.tudelft.nl/en/campusthehague/research/cass\n.\nTU Delft (Delft University of Technology)\nDelft University of Technology is built on strong foundations.

As this secondary resource becomes more abundant and diverse, it presents both a challenge and a strategic opportunity for circular metallurgy. Efficient and advanced recycling of scrap is critical to meet the growing demand for metals in a resource-constrained world and reduce their environmental footprint.In this context, the optimization of material recovery from end-of-life vehicle scrap is challenged not only by the heterogeneous and evolving nature of this scrap, but also by the diverse operational constraints and economic motivations across the value chain.<br><br>To address these challenges, the project will develop multi-modal artificial intelligence methods to characterize metal scrap composition with unprecedented detail, enabling dynamic, data-driven insight into the recoverable value of materials. Agentic AI systems will be designed to autonomously explore and propose optimal dismantling, sorting, and processing routes tailored to specific scrap streams. These intelligent agents will integrate scrap data and industry constraints to recommend strategies that maximize resource recovery and economic return. Together, these AI-driven tools will serve as a foundation for decision-making platforms that guide industry stakeholders toward more efficient, profitable, and sustainable recycling practices across the circular steel ecosystem.<br><br>This PhD position is part of the Groeien met Groen Staal program from the Dutch national growth fund (https://groeienmetgroenstaal.nl). The Groein met Groen Staal program is the enabler of a revolution in green steel production at national and international arenas. It will develop solutions to overcome technical, economic and societal bottlenecks towards the following overarching goals: i) Making Dutch steel sector a leader in sustainable steel; ii) Quadrupling of scrap sorting activities; iii) Tripling of steel reuse and remanufacturing activities; iv) Reducing dependence on foreign steel/iron ore through scrap recycling; v) Reducing industry CO2 emissions by 30% and reduce other emissions (including nitrogen oxides and particulate matter) by 50%.<br><br>The project contributes to reaching this overarching objective by enabling increased: i) cost/energy efficiency in recycling/recovery of metals from scrap, ii) scrap value, iii) recycled scrap amounts, iv) amounts of recovered critical elements.<br><br>This PhD position is also part of the interdisciplinary Climate Safety &amp; Security centre (CaSS) at TU Delft | Campus The Hague.

      "description_en": "Interested to push the technological limits of energy kites and contribute to the industrialization of a promising disruptive renewable energy technology, collaborating with leading developers?\nJob description\nWind energy is a critical component of the energy transition. Although it is one of the fastest-growing renewable energy sources globally, the targeted threefold increase of installed generation capacity until 2030 will be challenging to meet. Airborne wind energy (AWE) is an emerging technology that can complement conventional turbines while reducing the material consumption and environmental impact of energy generation.\nThis PhD project is part of the MSCA Doctoral Network AWETRAIN (Airborne Wind Energy TRAining for Industrialization Network). Its objective is to investigate the optimal configuration for utility-scale AWE farms, considering the physics, economics, and environmental impact. To determine the optimal scaling strategies for kite farms, a toolchain comprising a statistical description of the wind resource and physics-based models of the AWE system will be combined with a cost model of the farm. Is it better to scale up the individual systems or to combine multiple smaller-scale systems into a farm? The cost model will be augmented with a life cycle analysis to incorporate the environmental impact of the used materials into the analysis. All relevant interaction mechanisms between the individual AWE systems of the farm will be taken into account. Many components of this toolchain already exist and have been validated for smaller-scale AWE systems (\nhttps://github.com/awegroup/\n).\nThe main activities of this project will be: i) combining wind resource statistics with a physics-based system engineering model, focused on kite design and nominal operation, using this toolchain for preliminary optimization of AWE devices and plants based on physical metrics, ii) adding a cost model for AWE farms, and using this for preliminary optimization of AWE systems and farms based on economic metrics, iii) extending the cost model with data on environmental impact from life cycle analysis, using this for optimization of AWE devices and plants based on combinations of physical, economic and environmental metrics.\nYou will be a member of the Wind Energy Section’s Airborne Wind Energy Research Group, a leading academic player in the AWE sector, and will collaborate with two fellow AWETRAIN PhD researchers in Delft: one with the neighboring Faculty of Technology, Policy and Management (TPM) and one with the research group's spin-off company Kitepower B.V. You will also have the opportunity to meet regularly and collaborate with the other PhD researchers of the AWETRAIN Doctoral Network (\nhttps://awetrain.eu\n) that are located all across Europe. This will include secondments to industry partners.\nEligibility criteria\nFulfillment of eligibility criteria is dictated by the European Commission under the Horizon MSCA Doctoral Networks Programme. We welcome applications from PhD candidates from any country fulfilling the following mobility criteria:\n- Eligible candidates must not have resided or carried out their main activity (work, studies, etc.) in the country of their first host institution for more than 12 months in the 3 years immediately before their recruitment by the host institution (i.e., the starting date indicated in the employment contract/equivalent direct contract).\n- Eligible candidates must have a master’s degree relevant to the chosen position or its equivalent that would entitle them to a doctorate, awarded before the start of the position.\nTU Delft (Delft University of Technology)\nDelft University of Technology is built on strong foundations. As creators of the world-famous Dutch waterworks and pioneers in biotech, TU Delft is a top international university combining science, engineering and design. It delivers world class results in education, research and innovation to address challenges in the areas of energy, climate, mobility, health and digital society. For generations, our engineers have proven to be entrepreneurial problem-solvers, both in business and in a social context.\nAt TU Delft we embrace diversity as one of our core\nvalues\nand we actively\nengage\nto be a university where you feel at home and can flourish. We value different perspectives and qualities. We believe this makes our work more innovative, the TU Delft community more vibrant and the world more just. Together, we imagine, invent and create solutions using technology to have a positive impact on a global scale. That is why we invite you to apply. Your application will receive fair consideration.\nChallenge. Change. Impact!\nFaculty Aerospace Engineering\nThe Faculty of Aerospace Engineering at Delft University of Technology is one of the world’s most highly ranked (and most comprehensive) research, education and innovation communities devoted entirely to aerospace engineering. More than 200 science staff, around 270 PhD candidates and close to 3000 BSc and MSc students apply aerospace engineering disciplines to address the global societal challenges that threaten us today, climate change without doubt being the most important.

Although it is one of the fastest-growing renewable energy sources globally, the targeted threefold increase of installed generation capacity until 2030 will be challenging to meet. Airborne wind energy (AWE) is an emerging technology that can complement conventional turbines while reducing the material consumption and environmental impact of energy generation.<br><br>This PhD project is part of the MSCA Doctoral Network AWETRAIN (Airborne Wind Energy TRAining for Industrialization Network). Its objective is to investigate the optimal configuration for utility-scale AWE farms, considering the physics, economics, and environmental impact. To determine the optimal scaling strategies for kite farms, a toolchain comprising a statistical description of the wind resource and physics-based models of the AWE system will be combined with a cost model of the farm. Is it better to scale up the individual systems or to combine multiple smaller-scale systems into a farm? The cost model will be augmented with a life cycle analysis to incorporate the environmental impact of the used materials into the analysis. All relevant interaction mechanisms between the individual AWE systems of the farm will be taken into account. Many components of this toolchain already exist and have been validated for smaller-scale AWE systems (<a href=\"https://github.com/awegroup/\">https://github.com/awegroup/</a>).<br><br>The main activities of this project will be: i) combining wind resource statistics with a physics-based system engineering model, focused on kite design and nominal operation, using this toolchain for preliminary optimization of AWE devices and plants based on physical metrics, ii) adding a cost model for AWE farms, and using this for preliminary optimization of AWE systems and farms based on economic metrics, iii) extending the cost model with data on environmental impact from life cycle analysis, using this for optimization of AWE devices and plants based on combinations of physical, economic and environmental metrics.<br><br>You will be a member of the Wind Energy Section’s Airborne Wind Energy Research Group, a leading academic player in the AWE sector, and will collaborate with two fellow AWETRAIN PhD researchers in Delft: one with the neighboring Faculty of Technology, Policy and Management (TPM) and one with the research group's spin-off company Kitepower B.V.

These joints play a critical role in vibration damping and energy dissipation, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood and difficult to model. This NWO-funded project aims to develop new theoretical and experimental frameworks to identify and characterize friction damping in assembled systems, bridging the gap between microscale friction phenomena and macroscale structural dynamics.\nAs a PhD candidate, you will focus on the identification and modeling of friction damping and energy dissipation in assembled structures. Your work will combine theoretical modeling, numerical simulation, and experimental validation.\nKey objectives can include:\n- Developing theoretical and computational models for friction-induced damping in joints and interfaces.\n- Formulating identification strategies to extract damping parameters from experimental data.\n- Linking microscale frictional behavior to macroscale dynamic response through nonlinear modeling.\n- Designing and conducting controlled experiments to validate and calibrate models.\n- Collaborating closely with industrial partners to apply findings to representative aerospace and mechanical assemblies.\nYour research will contribute to advancing predictive tools for vibration reduction in high performance structures, crucial for structural, aerospace and offshore engineering applications.\nThe research will be carried out within a multidisciplinary team of three researchers (two PhDs and one Postdoc), and in close collaboration with major industrial and research partners, including ESA (European Space Agency), Airbus, Rolls-Royce, and NRL (Netherlands Aerospace Centre).

      "description_en": "The Mathematical Institute is looking for a PhD candidate to join the project, under the supervision of Francesca Arici, Bram Mesland and Irene Aguilera (UvA)\nWhat you will do\nApplications are invited for a 4-year PhD position at the Mathematical Institute of the University of Leiden, as part of the project\nNew K-theoretic invariants in quantum theory\nwithin the national consortium\nEmergence at all scales\nThe position is based in the Analysis and Dynamical Systems group of the Mathematical Institute at Leiden University, in collaboration (70/30) with\nIrene Aguilera’s group\nat the University of Amsterdam.\nThe overarching aim of this project is to interpret the topological physics encoded by possibly non-Hermitian and non-gapped Hamiltonians within the mathematical framework of noncommutative geometry.\nThe proposed research revolves around the following key objectives:\n- Finding analytic expressions for families of numerical Hamiltonians that model magnetic topological semimetals.\n- Classifying such Hamiltonians in terms of invariants of operator algebras, such as K-theory and cyclic homology; and\n- Developing a mathematical method for passing from numerical Berry curvature to robust topological invariants in a large class of cases.\nTo achieve these objectives, the PhD candidate will combine the analytical tools from the theory of operator algebras and noncommutative geometry (Arici, Mesland) with the study of data obtained from simulations of tight-binding Hamiltonians (Aguilera). The project aims to develop mathematical tools that will further elucidate the intricate aspects of topology in quantum matter.\nIf selected for this position you are expected to participate in the various scientific activities, meetings and workshops of the Emergence At All Scales consortium, to form interdisciplinary collaborations across fields and geographical locations within the Netherlands, and to acquire skills by active participation in science communication activities, interacting with public audiences and taking part in a pilot programme where experience can be acquired in high school science teaching.\nThe consortium Emergence at all Scales is the national flag-carrier of the NWA route 2 game changer\nDutch Institute for Emergent Phenomena\n. EAAS combines 8 Dutch and 1 Ukrainian university as well as Statistics Netherlands (CBS) in an interdisciplinary and collaborative endeavour aimed at understanding emergent phenomena across scales, combining multiple fields including physics, mathematics, astronomy, history & philosophy of science, and social science. Its approach to societal engagement throughout the project’s 5- year lifetime is equally interdisciplinary, with a wide variety of activities ranging from art/science programmes, large scale science festivals, citizen science and educational initiatives at various levels. EAAS is hiring a total of 20 PhD/postdoc scientists to join the team, and our project/group leaders share the ambition of gender parity in hires across EAAS. We particularly encourage women and candidates from other under-represented groups to apply.\nWhere you will work\nThe Mathematical Institute (MI) is one of the eight institutes within the Faculty of Science and has a strong international orientation.

Are you challenged by learning and applying cutting-edge molecular biology techniques to address your research questions? Then this job may be for you!\nJoin us!\nThe bacterial pathogen\nXanthomonas campestris\npv.\ncampestris\n(Xcc) causes black rot disease, a significant threat to cabbage crops worldwide. This pathogen enters the vascular system via hydathodes, tiny water pores of leaves that are connected to the xylem vein endings, and spreads systemically. Plants defend themselves against microbial invaders with an immune system involving pattern recognition receptors (PRR) at the cell surface that perceive immune elicitors (also known as MAMPs or DAMPs) activating plant immunity.\nCurrently, we have little understanding of the immune mechanisms in hydathodes and in the vasculature. Are there tissue-specific PRRs that contribute to resistance against Xcc? What are the cognate elicitors that activate PRR signalling? Does the plant detect also non-pathogenic bacteria in the hydathode?\nTasks and responsibilities\nThis project aims to identify immune elicitors (also known as MAMPs or DAMPs) as ligands of PRRs activating plant immunity during Xcc infection in the model plant\nArabidopsis thaliana\n. You will screen for immune-eliciting molecules/proteins using plant immune assays and identify the elicitor by mass spectrometry. The receptor-ligand interaction will be further characterized by applying protein biochemistry methods. In addition, you will study plant resistance in different tissues by employing bioluminescent Xcc reporter strains that allow us to non-invasively track bacterial spread inside leaves. Lastly, you will investigate the relevance of the identified immune signalling pathway against pathogenic and commensal bacteria.\nThe overarching goal of this research is to deepen our understanding of the molecular interactions between vascular\nXanthomonas\nand host plants. The findings of this project may ultimately support the development of\nXanthomonas\n-resistant cabbage varieties through informed breeding strategies.\nThis project will be carried out in the\nMolecular Plant Pathology\ngroup, part of the\nGreen Life Sciences\ntheme at the\nSwammerdam Institute for Life Sciences\n. Research in our group aims at advancing fundamental knowledge of the interactions between plants and their pathogens, using state-of-the-art methods in molecular biology, genetics, biochemistry, and microbiology. In addition, we seek opportunities to translate fundamental insights of plant-pathogen interactions into solutions to enhance disease resistance in crops. This project is funded by an ERC Starting grant of the European Commission under the Horizon Europe program.\nYou will:\n- complete a PhD thesis within the official appointment duration of four years; perform your experiments in a systematic and controlled manner and keep records by properly documenting and organizing your work;\n- be an active member of the research group, give feedback to others and take responsibility for shared tasks;\n- discuss your work with group members and during company update meetings to incorporate feedback;\n- take a leading role in writing manuscripts for publication in peer-reviewed journals;\n- participate in the PhD training programme of the University of Amsterdam and the Dutch Experimental School of Plant Sciences (EPS); assist in teaching and supervising Bachelor and Master internships\nYou will get the opportunity to:\n- present your results at (inter)national scientific conferences;\n- expand you academic, professional, and personal skills;\n- contribute to science communication and outreach activities;\n- thrive in a team that values impactful research and mutual support;\n- combine the advantages that a collaborative project offers, such as access to state-of-the art research facilities at UvA and collaboration partners.\nYour profile\nYou are passionate about science and have a particular interest in molecular plant pathology. You enjoy performing experimental lab work (e.g. molecular biology, plant transformations, disease assays), as well as genome data analysis using bioinformatic tools. You have a creative mind and look forward to learning and applying your skills and knowhow. Finally, you are a team player and a pleasant colleague who enjoys being part of an international team of plant scientists.\nYour experience and profile\nYou have/are\n- an MSc degree in molecular biology/biochemistry/plant biology;\n- demonstrated hands-on experience with some of the following techniques and skills: protein biochemistry, liquid chromatography, cloning, plant growth and infections, plant immune assays;\n- fluent in English, both written and spoken.\nOur offer\nWe offer a temporary contract for 38 hours per week for the duration of 4 years (the initial contract will be for a period of 18 months and after satisfactory evaluation it will be extended for a total duration of 4 years). The preferred starting date is February 1st 2026. This should lead to a dissertation (PhD thesis). We will draft an educational plan that includes attendance of courses and (international) meetings.

Alisa van de Haar (university lecturer in historical French literature at Leiden University). Prof. Nadine Akkerman (professor in early modern literature and culture at Leiden University) will be the co-supervisor of the PhD candidate.\nThe project\nThe LangPro project examines the notion of the language sector in early modern North-West Europe: that part of early modern societies and economies which relied primarily on language skills. The early modern period saw a swift increase in occupational opportunities for men and women who possessed language skills such as reading, writing, and text editing in one or more languages. However, since language professionals have never been studied as a separate category in the early modern workforce, the possibilities that existed for linguistically skilled individuals remain a big unknown. LangPro’s central research question is: What professional, financial, and social opportunities did the early modern language sector offer to men and women in the Low Countries, France, the German lands, and England, between 1550 and 1650? Laying the groundwork for a new research domain on the history of the language sector, the project team will develop a prosopographical database that makes it possible to gain insight into the characteristics of professionals in the past whose core business was language and the nature of the sector that employed them.\nPhD position: Women in the Early Modern Language Sector\n- The PhD candidate will conduct a collective analysis of a selection of early modern female language professionals from England, the Low Countries, France, and the German lands to explore to what extent women could benefit from employment in the language industry. Although women (with only a few exceptions) did not have access to academic education, language skills offered them a way to pursue intellectual professions, such as translator or language teacher. For each of these women, The PhD will examine their biographical data, personal writings, and correspondence in order to find patterns in the language skills they professed, the ways in which they found and secured employment, and the financial and social benefits they obtained through their language work. Besides working on this individual research project, the PhD candidate will also collaborate with other team members in the LangPro project to build a database on early modern language professionals.\nKey responsibilities\n- Conducting research on the role of women in the early modern language sector. Part of this research will take place in archives and libraries in the UK, Belgium, Germany, and France;\n- Completing a PhD thesis (in English) within four years;\n- Contributing to the project’s collaborative database;\n- Publishing at least two (co-authored) articles in peer-reviewed journals or volumes;\n- Presenting papers at conferences, both in the Netherlands and internationally;\n- Participating in monthly meetings of the project research group;\n- Participating in the training programme of the LUCAS (Leiden University Centre for the Arts in Society) Institute, the Leiden Graduate School of Humanities, the Huizinga Institute (Netherlands Research School for Cultural History), and other relevant masterclasses, summer schools, seminars, workshops, and events;\n- Participating in the PhD community and the intellectual life of the LUCAS Institute;\n- Subject to progress and demand, some teaching in the second and third years of your PhD project, in line with your expertise and prior experience.\nYour profile\n- You hold a ResMA/MRes or MA with a specialisation in history, early modern studies, literature, or languages;\n- Your ResMA/MA should be awarded by time of appointment, with a grade of 8.0 or above on a ten-point scale (distinction or equivalent) for your thesis. If the MA thesis is not yet finished, we invite you to provide contact details for your supervisor in your application letter so we may consult with them on your progress;\n- You are willing to work up to 2 months in archives and libraries in the UK, Belgium, France, and Germany in year 1 and year 2 of the project, up to a total of 4 months for the duration of the project;\n- You have well-developed research skills, including the ability to formulate creative research questions, descriptive and analytical skills, and a clear and persuasive style of writing;\n- You have an interest in or affinity with the language sector and gender studies;\n- You have experience with or are willing to learn about early modern (hand)writing in Dutch, English, German, and French;\n- You have full professional working proficiency in English (speaking, writing, reading);\n- You have professional working proficiency in German, French and/or Dutch, (especially reading), or a willingness to learn one of these languages. Knowledge of Latin is a bonus;\n- You have proven time-management skills;\n- You are a team player and independent thinker;\n- You have the ability to finish the proposed PhD research in 4 years.\nInternational candidates are encouraged to apply but must be willing to relocate to the Netherlands for the duration of the project.\nThe organisation\nThe Faculty of Humanities at Leiden University is a unique international centre for the advanced study of languages, cultures, arts, and societies worldwide, in their historical contexts from prehistory to the present. Our faculty is home to more than 6,000 students and 800 staff members.

Alisa van de Haar (university lecturer in historical French literature at Leiden University). Prof. Nadine Akkerman (professor in early modern literature and culture at Leiden University) will be the co-supervisor of the PhD candidate.\nThe project\nThe LangPro project examines the notion of the language sector in early modern North-West Europe: that part of early modern societies and economies which relied primarily on language skills. The early modern period saw a swift increase in occupational opportunities for men and women who possessed language skills such as reading, writing, and text editing in one or more languages. However, since language professionals have never been studied as a separate category in the early modern workforce, the possibilities that existed for linguistically skilled individuals remain a big unknown. LangPro’s central research question is: What professional, financial, and social opportunities did the early modern language sector offer to men and women in the Low Countries, France, the German lands, and England, between 1550 and 1650? Laying the groundwork for a new research domain on the history of the language sector, the project team will develop a prosopographical database that makes it possible to gain insight into the characteristics of professionals in the past whose core business was language and the nature of the sector that employed them.\nPhD position: Early Modern Language Associations: Societies and Guilds in the Language Industry\nThis PhD project will examine how language professionals supported each other by uniting in guilds, societies, and associations in early modern North-West Europe. To this end, the PhD candidate will study early modern archives of guilds and associations related to the language industry in the Low Countries, France, Germany, and England, between 1550 and 1650. Studying the organisations that were related to the language sector is imperative for our understanding of the functioning of this professional domain: to what extent and how did guilds in the language sector verify and guarantee the levels of language proficiency of their members? In what types of conflict did guilds in the language sector mediate? What schooling did they offer?\nThis PhD project will yield new insights into the differences between various regions in North-West Europe regarding the forms of institutional support that was available to language professionals, the professions to which these organisations catered (e.g. language teachers, secretaries, etc.), and their functioning. It will thus yield crucial insights into the social functioning of the early modern language sector, as well as into the functioning of the guild system itself. Besides working on this individual research project, the PhD candidate will also collaborate with other team members in the LangPro project to build a database on early modern language professionals.\nKey responsibilities\n- Conducting archival research on early modern guilds related to the language sector in North-West Europe. An important part of this research will take place in archives in the UK, Belgium, Germany, and France;\n- Completing a PhD thesis (in English) within four years;\n- Contributing to the project’s collaborative database;\n- Publishing at least two (co-authored) articles in peer-reviewed journals or volumes;\n- Presenting papers at conferences, both in the Netherlands and internationally;\n- Participating in monthly meetings of the project research group;\n- Participating in the training programme of the LUCAS (Leiden University Centre for the Arts in Society) Institute, the Leiden Graduate School of Humanities, the Huizinga Institute (Netherlands Research School for Cultural History), and other relevant masterclasses, summer schools, seminars, workshops, and events;\n- Participating in the PhD community and the intellectual life of the LUCAS Institute;\n- Subject to progress and demand, some teaching in the second and third years of your PhD project, in line with your expertise and prior experience.\nYour profile\n- You hold a ResMA/MRes or MA with a specialisation in history, early modern studies, or languages;\n- Your ResMA/MA should be awarded by time of appointment, with a grade of 8.0 or above on a ten-point scale (distinction or equivalent) for your thesis.

        "description": "<strong><em><strong>Derive a novel theoretical framework based on control theory to unlock the efficiency of neuromorphic compute in multi-timescale processing.</strong></em></strong><br><br><strong>Job description</strong><br>Neuromorphic computing promises new energy efficiency records by taking inspiration from biology. However, while the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron is the current de-facto neuron model in neuromorphic hardware, it embeds only one single time constant limited to a few tens of milliseconds. This simple unit is limiting the learning capabilities of recurrent neural network models in tasks characterized by multi-timescale and long-range temporal dependencies.<br><br>To implement multi-scale adaptation, in this PhD project, you will investigate the co-design between event-based learning algorithms and neuronal hardware units with multi-scale time constants. The algorithmic methodology will exploit recent developments of adaptive control for event-based systems.<br><br>You will drive a novel theoretical framework to learn with bio-inspired multi-scale recurrent neural networks, and design custom neuromorphic hardware that will demonstrate an efficiency advantage on complex temporal scenes based on multi-scale computing units.<br><br>At TU Delft, you will be joining the CogSys team (https://cogsys.tudelft.nl/), supervised by Dr. Charlotte Frenkel.<br>This project will be co-supervised by Prof. Rodolphe Sepulchre at KU Leuven.<br><br>On top of participating to the yearly annual retreats organized by the doctoral network participants, you will complete several internships:<br><ul> <li>one short internship at Innatera to ramp up on edge platforms,</li> <li>one or several long internships at KU Leuven with Prof. Rodolphe Sepulchre.</li>\n</ul>\n<br><strong>Job requirements</strong><br>We are looking for a highly motivated Ph.D. candidate.

      "description_en": "Do you like applying mathematical theories in practice to solve real-world challenges? Do you like working with top-notch, internationally recognized industrial partners? Would you like to push the boundaries of system-level modelling, analysis, design, exploration and synthesis beyond the current state-of-the-art? Or are you curious to learn more about the application of AI for system diagnostics and system evolution? We are offering six PhDs positions across the department of Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Mathematics and Computer Science that focus on solving cutting-edge design automation questions that will drive innovation in the Brainport region and beyond.\nInformation\nThe semiconductor industry is vital to global economic growth and technological progress, powering everything from energy solutions to healthcare innovations. Some parts of the design of these high-tech systems - lithography machines – can be automated. However, current design automation solutions are limited to specific domains or subsystems. Holistic system-level design is a necessary next-step because of the complexity of these systems. This implies going beyond current domain-specific solutions by combining mechanical, electrical, software, data science, and AI-expertise.\nWe are seeking highly-motivated candidates for the six PhD positions advertised here that address the challenge above by pushing the boundaries of 1) system-level co-design of architecture, functionality and performance, and 2) leverage system models to monitor and understand operational behaviour of systems and act upon irregularities. This description will continue with a description of all six positions:\nPhD 1: System architecture exploration\n(supervision by: Theo Hofman and Pascal Etman) [Department of Mechanical Engineering]\nThe research by this position aims to achieve automated computational design synthesis of system topologies. This will result in new and novel system topologies which can be automatically analysed and evaluated based on construction and performance indicators. This will require an insight into how to fully automate the discrete topology design synthesis process across system levels and how to learn component descriptions and how these can be interconnected.\nPhD 2: Scenario-based compositional system-level performance engineering\n(supervision by: Twan Basten, Marc Geilen) [Department of Electrical Engineering]\nThe research planned for this position will explore how to achieve correct behavior and required performance (in terms of throughput, latency), while considering concerns and constraints from various engineering domains by leveraging scenario-based design. This methodology considers systems from a behavioral perspective, clustering behaviors with similar characteristics. The envisioned model-based performance engineering starts from use cases (typical and exceptional) and various system scenarios (different operating modes, failures). This will require the development of suitable domain-specific languages (DSLs) to specify use cases from the perspective of the relevant domains as well as model transformation, analysis, and synthesis algorithms that provide functionally correct system configurations with a guaranteed performance. The research focuses on suitable domain models and the required model transformation, analysis, and synthesis approaches.\nWe require candidates for PhD 2 to have good software engineering and programming skills, good knowledge on modeling cyber-physical systems, and preferably experience with DSL development.\nPhD 3: Timing-aware distributed supervisory controller synthesis\n(supervision by: Michel Reniers and Martijn Goorden) [Department of Mechanical Engineering]\nThe automatic synthesis of supervisory controllers will support the design process of lithography machines. To achieve a computationally tractable automatic synthesis, a deep understanding is required into how the (control) architecture of lithography machines and the types of models can be used to capture their behaviour and requirements. This will enable splitting the problem of synthesizing safe supervisors into smaller synthesis problems, the results of which can be composed into a solution for the original system. This will require an understanding of how existing system decompositions and interface specifications be translated into models suitable for hierarchical/distributed supervisory control synthesis.\nWe require candidates for PhD 3 to have knowledge of discrete-event systems, and knowledge of or interest in learning about formal methods, in particular, the theory of Supervisory Controller Synthesis.\nPhD 4: AI-driven legacy system explanation and refactoring\n(supervision by: Lina Ochoa Venegas, Michel Chaudron, Jacob Krüger - collaboration with: Stef van den Elzen) [Department of Mathematics and Computer Science]\nMaintaining an understanding of complex systems with a vast amount of software requires effective architecture explanation frameworks, visualizations and identification of architectural refactoring opportunities in legacy systems. These elements will support onboarding, enhance team efficiency, reduce reliance on system experts, and accelerate software maintenance and development. This will require an understanding of how a system architecture can be extracted and represented in a language-agnostic way, relying in the capabilities of program analysis,generative AI, and advanced visualisation techniques.\nWe require candidates for PhD 4 to hold both a bachelor’s and a master’s degree in Computer Science, Data Science, Software Engineering, or a closely related field. Prior experience with the application and understanding of generative AI methods and tools, as well as a solid background in software engineering and a strong interest on visualisation techniques, are highly desirable.\nPhD 5: Data mining for diagnostics\n(supervision by: Mykola Pechenizkiy, Songgaojun (Amy) Deng) [Department of Mathematics and Computer Science]\nThis research, in close collaboration with ASML AI Research, is based on the promise of a novel framework that integrates evolving knowledge graphs (KGs) with domain-specific foundation models to enhance diagnostic capabilities. This research will look into how knowledge graphs be designed and generated from a combination of software stack, legacy code, and documentation (V-model steps: requirements, system design, module design, etc) to capture equipment behavior, process steps, and causal failure relations, as well as discrepancies between expected behavior from requirements and actual failures from deployed system. The latter knowledge graphs will then be integrated with foundation models to enhance machine interpretability in complex diagnostic environments.\nPhD 6: Automating health monitoring in semicon equipment\n(supervision by: Nathan van de Wouw, Tom Oomen, Michelle Chong) [Department of Mechanical Engineering]\nThis project aims to devise innovative monitoring technology for high-tech systems to perform (semi) autonomous fault isolation, and predictive monitoring. For high-tech equipment, such as those used in the production of semiconductors, monitoring is a challenge because of the highly complex interconnected systems they are consisting of many components/modules, which are functionally, digitally, and physically connected. To achieve such monitoring technology, an understanding is required of how to support the identification and prediction of rare failures, for which only scarce datasets are available.\nCurrent health monitoring technology is typically designed for either (i) individual system components/modules (which would require removing the component from the system, which is not possible in practice), or (ii) for the system as a whole. The first approach fails to account for the interaction between modules and its effect on the whole system. The second approach makes it challenging to isolate which module may be failing and how to zoom in on the part of the system that is the root cause of the failure. This PhD position will address this challenge by developing hierarchical diagnostic tools for complex dynamical systems.\nWe require candidates for PhD 6 to have a\nstrong background in mathematical control theory\nand a keen interest in hybrid dynamical systems, observer design, learning techniques and optimization.",

        "title": "Semiconductor industry; we are looking for 6 PhDs",
        "description": "Do you like applying mathematical theories in practice to solve real-world challenges? Do you like working with top-notch, internationally recognized industrial partners? Would you like to push the boundaries of system-level modelling, analysis, design, exploration and synthesis beyond the current state-of-the-art? Or are you curious to learn more about the application of AI for system diagnostics and system evolution? We are offering six PhDs positions across the department of Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Mathematics and Computer Science that focus on solving cutting-edge design automation questions that will drive innovation in the Brainport region and beyond.<br><br><strong>Information</strong><br>The semiconductor industry is vital to global economic growth and technological progress, powering everything from energy solutions to healthcare innovations. Some parts of the design of these high-tech systems - lithography machines – can be automated. However, current design automation solutions are limited to specific domains or subsystems. Holistic system-level design is a necessary next-step because of the complexity of these systems. This implies going beyond current domain-specific solutions by combining mechanical, electrical, software, data science, and AI-expertise.<br><br>We are seeking highly-motivated candidates for the six PhD positions advertised here that address the challenge above by pushing the boundaries of 1) system-level co-design of architecture, functionality and performance, and 2) leverage system models to monitor and understand operational behaviour of systems and act upon irregularities. This description will continue with a description of all six positions:<br><br><strong>PhD 1: System architecture exploration </strong>(supervision by: Theo Hofman and Pascal Etman) [Department of Mechanical Engineering]<br><br>The research by this position aims to achieve automated computational design synthesis of system topologies. This will result in new and novel system topologies which can be automatically analysed and evaluated based on construction and performance indicators. This will require an insight into how to fully automate the discrete topology design synthesis process across system levels and how to learn component descriptions and how these can be interconnected.<br><br><strong>PhD 2: Scenario-based compositional system-level performance engineering </strong>(supervision by: Twan Basten, Marc Geilen) [Department of Electrical Engineering]<br><br>The research planned for this position will explore how to achieve correct behavior and required performance (in terms of throughput, latency), while considering concerns and constraints from various engineering domains by leveraging scenario-based design. This methodology considers systems from a behavioral perspective, clustering behaviors with similar characteristics. The envisioned model-based performance engineering starts from use cases (typical and exceptional) and various system scenarios (different operating modes, failures). This will require the development of suitable domain-specific languages (DSLs) to specify use cases from the perspective of the relevant domains as well as model transformation, analysis, and synthesis algorithms that provide functionally correct system configurations with a guaranteed performance. The research focuses on suitable domain models and the required model transformation, analysis, and synthesis approaches.<br><br>We require candidates for PhD 2 to have good software engineering and programming skills, good knowledge on modeling cyber-physical systems, and preferably experience with DSL development.<br><br><strong>PhD 3: Timing-aware distributed supervisory controller synthesis </strong>(supervision by: Michel Reniers and Martijn Goorden) [Department of Mechanical Engineering]<br><br>The automatic synthesis of supervisory controllers will support the design process of lithography machines. To achieve a computationally tractable automatic synthesis, a deep understanding is required into how the (control) architecture of lithography machines and the types of models can be used to capture their behaviour and requirements. This will enable splitting the problem of synthesizing safe supervisors into smaller synthesis problems, the results of which can be composed into a solution for the original system. This will require an understanding of how existing system decompositions and interface specifications be translated into models suitable for hierarchical/distributed supervisory control synthesis.<br><br>We require candidates for PhD 3 to have knowledge of discrete-event systems, and knowledge of or interest in learning about formal methods, in particular, the theory of Supervisory Controller Synthesis.<br><br><strong>PhD 4: AI-driven legacy system explanation and refactoring </strong>(supervision by: Lina Ochoa Venegas, Michel Chaudron, Jacob Krüger - collaboration with: Stef van den Elzen) [Department of Mathematics and Computer Science]<br><br>Maintaining an understanding of complex systems with a vast amount of software requires effective architecture explanation frameworks, visualizations and identification of architectural refactoring opportunities in legacy systems. These elements will support onboarding, enhance team efficiency, reduce reliance on system experts, and accelerate software maintenance and development. This will require an understanding of how a system architecture can be extracted and represented in a language-agnostic way, relying in the capabilities of program analysis,generative AI, and advanced visualisation techniques.<br><br>We require candidates for PhD 4 to hold both a bachelor’s and a master’s degree in Computer Science, Data Science, Software Engineering, or a closely related field. Prior experience with the application and understanding of generative AI methods and tools, as well as a solid background in software engineering and a strong interest on visualisation techniques, are highly desirable.<br><br><strong>PhD 5: Data mining for diagnostics </strong>(supervision by: Mykola Pechenizkiy, Songgaojun (Amy) Deng) [Department of Mathematics and Computer Science]<br><br>This research, in close collaboration with ASML AI Research, is based on the promise of a novel framework that integrates evolving knowledge graphs (KGs) with domain-specific foundation models to enhance diagnostic capabilities. This research will look into how knowledge graphs be designed and generated from a combination of software stack, legacy code, and documentation (V-model steps: requirements, system design, module design, etc) to capture equipment behavior, process steps, and causal failure relations, as well as discrepancies between expected behavior from requirements and actual failures from deployed system. The latter knowledge graphs will then be integrated with foundation models to enhance machine interpretability in complex diagnostic environments.<br><br><strong>PhD 6: Automating health monitoring in semicon equipment </strong>(supervision by: Nathan van de Wouw, Tom Oomen, Michelle Chong) [Department of Mechanical Engineering]<br><br>This project aims to devise innovative monitoring technology for high-tech systems to perform (semi) autonomous fault isolation, and predictive monitoring. For high-tech equipment, such as those used in the production of semiconductors, monitoring is a challenge because of the highly complex interconnected systems they are consisting of many components/modules, which are functionally, digitally, and physically connected. To achieve such monitoring technology, an understanding is required of how to support the identification and prediction of rare failures, for which only scarce datasets are available.<br><br>Current health monitoring technology is typically designed for either (i) individual system components/modules (which would require removing the component from the system, which is not possible in practice), or (ii) for the system as a whole. The first approach fails to account for the interaction between modules and its effect on the whole system. The second approach makes it challenging to isolate which module may be failing and how to zoom in on the part of the system that is the root cause of the failure. This PhD position will address this challenge by developing hierarchical diagnostic tools for complex dynamical systems.<br><br>We require candidates for PhD 6 to have a <strong>strong background in mathematical control theory</strong> and a keen interest in hybrid dynamical systems, observer design, learning techniques and optimization.",

      "description_en": "This PhD project will develop socially just, context-sensitive adaptation strategies against heat stress in informal settlements, particularly in conflict-sensitive settings.\nJob description\nThe increasing frequency and intensity of heat stress due to climate change pose significant risks to vulnerable populations all over the world. This has led to some scholarship and the ensuing policy development in western countries mostly. The impacts of heat stress in informal settlements particularly for those displaced by conflict, is growing, however, is not well documented. This PhD project aims to explore the conceptualization of justice in enhancing adaptive capacities against heat stress in such environments, particularly in conflict-sensitive settings.\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) defines risk as the potential adverse consequences arising from climate-related hazards and the vulnerability of affected systems. The vulnerability framework comprises three crucial elements: exposure to hazards, sensitivity of systems, and capacity to adapt. Recent IPCC assessments have shifted the understanding of exposure, emphasizing that it is an internal quality impacted by external stressors. This transition reflects the need to acknowledge not just environmental factors but also the socio-economic and cultural contexts that shape vulnerability to heat.\nThis research will employ a multi-disciplinary approach to analyse the barriers and opportunities for adaptive capacity to heat stress, incorporating insights from social justice theories. It will assess how factors like poverty, social inequality, infrastructures (including housing) and community resources influence adaptive capacities. Moreover, the project will investigate how societal tensions interact with heat adaptive actions.\nKey objectives of this project are i) developing an holistic understanding of people’s vulnerability to heat in relation to their geographical, cultural, political and climatic context, ii) assessing the role of factors relating to perception (e.g., knowledge and attitude), gender, household composition, home ownership, education, access to resources, migration status and political context in adaptive capacity and iii) developing socially just heat adaptation strategies, that are context and conflict sensitive.\nThis PhD position is situated at the Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment, Department of Urbanism, section of Environmental Technology and Design. The section of Environmental Technology and Design (ETD) contributes to inter- and transdisciplinary, context-driven, and problem/solution-focused research and education for the sake of a better environment. It involves a collaborative design and engineering approach, with social-and environmental-based methods and techniques as operative instruments, as well as the development and application of advanced urban data science and geospatial information technologies to support this primary aim. For this project, we envision a strong collaboration with the Faculty of Technology, Policy and Management, Department of Values, Technology and Innovation, and particularly the Section of Ethics and Philosophy of Technology. This Section has a world-leading position in ethics of technology, and in recent years, several dissertations have been presented and successfully defended, spelling out the implications of social justice in climate adaptation as well as climate mitigation technologies.\nThis PhD position is also part of the interdisciplinary Climate Safety & Security centre (CaSS) at TU Delft | Campus The Hague. This centre runs an ambitious and comprehensive programme that considers climate change and stability in an integrated manner, with focus on human security, security of supply of fundamental needs (water, food) and essential resources (energy, critical materials). The PhD will contribute to the flagship Human Security within CaSS. For more information on the TU Delft | Climate Safety & Security centre see: www.tudelft.nl/cass.\nTU Delft (Delft University of Technology)\nDelft University of Technology is built on strong foundations. As creators of the world-famous Dutch waterworks and pioneers in biotech, TU Delft is a top international university combining science, engineering and design. It delivers world class results in education, research and innovation to address challenges in the areas of energy, climate, mobility, health and digital society.

        "description": "<strong><em>This PhD project will develop socially just, context-sensitive adaptation strategies against heat stress in informal settlements, particularly in conflict-sensitive settings. </em></strong><br><br><strong>Job description</strong><br>The increasing frequency and intensity of heat stress due to climate change pose significant risks to vulnerable populations all over the world. This has led to some scholarship and the ensuing policy development in western countries mostly. The impacts of heat stress in informal settlements particularly for those displaced by conflict, is growing, however, is not well documented. This PhD project aims to explore the conceptualization of justice in enhancing adaptive capacities against heat stress in such environments, particularly in conflict-sensitive settings.<br><br>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) defines risk as the potential adverse consequences arising from climate-related hazards and the vulnerability of affected systems. The vulnerability framework comprises three crucial elements: exposure to hazards, sensitivity of systems, and capacity to adapt. Recent IPCC assessments have shifted the understanding of exposure, emphasizing that it is an internal quality impacted by external stressors. This transition reflects the need to acknowledge not just environmental factors but also the socio-economic and cultural contexts that shape vulnerability to heat.<br><br>This research will employ a multi-disciplinary approach to analyse the barriers and opportunities for adaptive capacity to heat stress, incorporating insights from social justice theories. It will assess how factors like poverty, social inequality, infrastructures (including housing) and community resources influence adaptive capacities. Moreover, the project will investigate how societal tensions interact with heat adaptive actions.<br><br>Key objectives of this project are i) developing an holistic understanding of people’s vulnerability to heat in relation to their geographical, cultural, political and climatic context, ii) assessing the role of factors relating to perception (e.g., knowledge and attitude), gender, household composition, home ownership, education, access to resources, migration status and political context in adaptive capacity and iii) developing socially just heat adaptation strategies, that are context and conflict sensitive.<br><br>This PhD position is situated at the Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment, Department of Urbanism, section of Environmental Technology and Design. The section of Environmental Technology and Design (ETD) contributes to inter- and transdisciplinary, context-driven, and problem/solution-focused research and education for the sake of a better environment. It involves a collaborative design and engineering approach, with social-and environmental-based methods and techniques as operative instruments, as well as the development and application of advanced urban data science and geospatial information technologies to support this primary aim. For this project, we envision a strong collaboration with the Faculty of Technology, Policy and Management, Department of Values, Technology and Innovation, and particularly the Section of Ethics and Philosophy of Technology. This Section has a world-leading position in ethics of technology, and in recent years, several dissertations have been presented and successfully defended, spelling out the implications of social justice in climate adaptation as well as climate mitigation technologies.<br><br>This PhD position is also part of the interdisciplinary Climate Safety &amp; Security centre (CaSS) at TU Delft | Campus The Hague. This centre runs an ambitious and comprehensive programme that considers climate change and stability in an integrated manner, with focus on human security, security of supply of fundamental needs (water, food) and essential resources (energy, critical materials). The PhD will contribute to the flagship Human Security within CaSS.

In this 4-year fully funded position, you will combine 2 toolsets: generating proxy data reflecting surface ocean changes, and simulations of sea level changes using comprehensive ice sheet models.\nThe sea level in the Eemian was much higher than today, 3 to 6 m or even higher. The high sea levels during the Eemian cannot be explained by a complete melting of the Greenland ice sheet, as large parts of it survived the Eemian stage.

The aim of this research project is to further investigate the timing of major sea level changes, and thus the contribution of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets during the Eemian by generating high-resolution proxy records from the Dutch subsurface, including the type locality of the Eemian near the city of Amersfoort. Special emphasis will be on the varying background conditions between the Saalian to Eemian transition (i.e., termination II), when large ice sheets formed the Dutch coastline and the adjacent North Sea, and that of the LGM-Holocene transition (i.e., termination I), when large ice caps lay further north. The comparison between these new datasets and experiments with ice sheet models could lead to a better long-term projection of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets in our warming world.\nThe project is highly multidisciplinary and collaborative. Proxy data will amongst others infer the stable isotope composition of foraminifera and mollusc shells, since not much is known about the changes in temperature and isotopic composition of the waters flooding the Netherlands and other parts of Northwest Europe during past interglacial periods, such as the Eemian.

Join us in shaping how additive manufacturing (AM) can help Dutch industry.\nJob description\nWe are looking for a highly motivated PhD candidate who will contribute to Work Package 3 of the Add-reAM project, a large NWO-funded interdisciplinary programme:\n- Universities: TU Delft, UTwente, TU Eindhoven, Erasmus University Rotterdam, ULeiden, Saxion University of Applied Sciences.\n- Research institutes: M2i, NEN.\n- Municipalities: Terneuzen.\n- Companies and associations: Stichting Repair Cafes, Capgemini, Signify, Ramlab, Allseas, Techniek Nederland, SKF, GKN,MX3D, ProRail, Siemens, Berenschot Group, MKB Twente, UltiMaker, Vanderlande, 3devo, International Institute of Welding, Greenwise Campus, Regional Development Agency Oost NL, InNo Time, Logistics Centre of Excellence of the Royal Netherlands Army, Association FME.\nAdd-reAM aims to foster a sustainable, circular future where waste is minimized, resources are conserved and consumer needs are met without compromising the planet's health.\nWhile WP1 focusses on the next-generation AM, WP2 designs remanufacturing using AM, WP3 looks into regulatory, economic, political, environmental, and social innovations.\nYour research will analyse AM in the Netherlands within geopolitical and socioeconoimc context. The current geopolitical turmoil is increasingly answered with industrial strategies, at EU and NL level, though much is still unclear. A clear ambition is to increase innovation, though after decades of deregulation, no clear industrial strategy, and even the closure of the Ministry of Planning in The Netherlands, a decent understanding, let alone a steering of industry is lacking. Building on earlier research, this PhD project will therefore analyse the structure and dynamics of industrial ecosystems surrounding AM in the Netherlands, examining how firms, institutions, and infrastructures interact to enable—or constrain—the development of a competitive and sustainable AM sector.\nThe PhD is situated within economic geography and spatial planning, and will use a mixed methods approach wherein quantitative data (e.g. socioeconomic and logistical data) will be combined with qualitative data (e.g. policy documents, interviews, expert sessions) to achieve an as complete possible analysis of the status-quo. Subsequently, pro-actively and in co-creation, public and private policy recommendations will be formulated to achieve a successful additive manufacturing in Dutch industry.\nCase-studies will be defined during the project, in close collaboration with the consortium.\nYou will:\n- Build a database model of different socio-economic and material data in order to have a nodal-relational dataset for the relevant industries.\n- Further expand the existing visualisation methodology enabling to combine topographical and topological data, to visualise the actor-networks.\n- Organise interviews and expert sessions to verify and improve the results, in order to eventually produce policy recommendations.\n- Collaborate across disciplines with fellow PhDs in Add-reAM.\n- Present your work in academic publications, policy briefs, conferences and workshops with public and private stakeholders.\nTU Delft (Delft University of Technology)\nDelft University of Technology is built on strong foundations. As creators of the world-famous Dutch waterworks and pioneers in biotech, TU Delft is a top international university combining science, engineering and design.

As a PhD researcher at TU Delft, you’ll contribute to breakthrough science within “Growth with Green Steel” - a national research consortium driving the Netherlands’ transition to fossil-free iron production.\nJob description\nSteel is one of the most critical engineering materials in modern society, significantly enhancing our quality of life through its versatile applications. However, its large-scale primary production is associated with substantial anthropogenic CO2 emissions, contributing approximately 30% of global industrial CO2 emissions and about 7% of global energy consumption. As a result, the steel industry stands among the largest single contributors to global CO2 emissions and faces an urgent decarbonization challenge.\nA significant portion, ~75-80% of CO2 emissions, in steel production arises during the reduction of iron ore (ironmaking) in blast furnaces using carbon-based reductants such as coke and coal. To achieve meaningful emissions reductions, fossil-free ironmaking processes are essential. Among emerging solutions, hydrogen-based direct reduction (HyDR) has gained prominence as a leading green ironmaking route, offering the potential to eliminate direct CO2 emissions during iron ore reduction.This PhD position is part of\nGrowth with Green Steel\n, an exciting and collaborative research programme within the Dutch National Growth Fund, bringing together leading universities, research institutes, and industry partners to accelerate the transition to sustainable iron and steel production.\nAs a PhD researcher you will:\n- Investigate how gangue elements affect the reduction behaviour of iron ore pellets under various process conditions.\n- Analyse local elemental partitioning and microstructural evolution of iron ore pellets, and correlated this to overall reduction kinetics.\n- Study the carburization behaviour of reduced pellets and its effect on melting performance.\n- Apply a multiscale characterization strategy to link microscopic phenomena to macroscopic process outcomes.\n- This fundamental research will contribute to optimizing the HyDR process and pellet design, thereby accelerating the decarbonization of the steel industry.\nSustainable Metallurgy Laboratory\nYou will be part of the\nSustainable Metallurgy Laboratory\nwithin the\nDepartment of Materials Science and Engineering\nat TU Delft. The lab focuses on the understanding of microstructure formation and evolution in sustainable metal production, processing, and recycling by bridging chemical and physical metallurgy.

Forensisch onderzoek moet uitwijzen wat er is gebeurd: is het kindje geschud of geslagen, of misschien per ongeluk gevallen? Er is echter nog veel onbekend over, bijv., bij welke krachten letsel bij deze kinderen optreedt. Hierdoor zijn er ook nog geen goede forensische tools om objectief van verschillende scenario’s te testen welke tot letsel kunnen leiden.\nProject OpenTwin:\nDe Forensic BioMechanical Engineering groep heeft van NWO een subsidie gekregen om OpenTwin te ontwikkelen. OpenTwin zal bestaan uit twee nauw met elkaar samenhangende delen:\n- SENSA, een aanpasbare, antropomorfische schudpop vol sensoren, en waarmee scenario’s kunnen worden nagebootst terwijl de kinematica wordt gemeten.\nSENSA, een aanpasbare, antropomorfische schudpop vol sensoren, en waarmee scenario’s kunnen worden nagebootst terwijl de kinematica wordt gemeten.\n- SIMSON, simulatiesoftware voor het voorspellen en vergelijken van kinematica voor verschillende letselscenario’s.\nMet SENSA zal kinematische data worden verzameld door verdachten, getuigen of onderzoekers scenario’s te laten nabootsen waarvan wordt geclaimd of vermoed dat ze tot het letsel hebben geleid. SIMSON gebruikt vervolgens SENSA's output om een breed bereik aan variaties van het gesimuleerde scenario te simuleren. Het is de bedoeling dat OpenTwin als output objectieve, transparante en makkelijk te interpreteren forensische rapporten levert over de biomechanische waarschijnlijkheid van verschillende scenario’s als oorzaak van letsel dat bij een kindje is gevonden.\nOpenTwin wordt een open platform, met daarin SENSA als open hardware als SIMSON als open software, ontwikkeld met gebruikers en partners in de strafrechtketen die belang hebben bij deze nieuwe forensische tool. Ontwerpeisen zijn o.a. dat het systeem modulair, betaalbaar, makkelijk te maken en intuïtief in gebruik is. Zo zal OpenTwin bijdragen aan veiligheid en gerechtigheid voor iedereen en eindelijk uitkomst bieden in de veel in rechtszalen gevoerde discussie of schudden tot letsel bij jonge kinderen kan leiden. Hiermee helpen wij, en dan ook jij, voorkomen dat schuldige daders ongestraft blijven en kinderen (opnieuw) kunnen mishandelen, maar ook dat onschuldige ouders hun kindje kwijtraken. En vooral beschermen we daarmee de kinderen; zowel tegen het terug geplaats worden bij daders als tegen het weggehaald worden bij onschuldige ouders.\nOnderzoeksteam & werkomgeving:\n- Je werkt nauw samen met de andere PhD ( zie onze andere vacature ), want jullie systemen moeten naadloos in elkaar passen.\nzie onze andere vacature\n- Jullie hebben een OpenSim technicus, onze werkplaats en onze ervaren constructeurs en adviseurs tot je beschikking.\n- Jullie worden in dit door NWO gefinancierde project ondersteund door onze internationale gebruikerscommissie met experts uit de hele strafrechtketen tot jullie beschikking (Politie, NFI, OM, rechters, forensisch artsen en biomechanici).

      "description_en": "Help jij ons kinderen en onschuldige ouders beschermen door een testpop vol forensische technologie te ontwikkelen?\nFunctieomschrijving\nAchtergrond:\nElk jaar worden 14-41 per 100.000 kinderen zo gewelddadig geschud dat zij daardoor korte en lange termijn fysieke en cognitieve beperkingen en verwondingen oplopen of zelfs overlijden. Forensisch onderzoek moet uitwijzen wat er is gebeurd: is het kindje geschud of geslagen, of misschien per ongeluk gevallen? Er is echter nog veel onbekend over, bijv., bij welke krachten letsel bij deze kinderen optreedt. Hierdoor zijn er ook nog geen goede forensische tools om objectief van verschillende scenario’s te testen welke tot letsel kunnen leiden.\nProject OpenTwin:\nDe Forensic BioMechanical Engineering groep heeft van NWO een subsidie gekregen om OpenTwin te ontwikkelen. OpenTwin zal bestaan uit twee nauw met elkaar samenhangende delen:\n- SENSA, een aanpasbare, antropomorfische schudpop vol sensoren, en waarmee scenario’s kunnen worden nagebootst terwijl de kinematica wordt gemeten.\n- SIMSON, simulatiesoftware voor het voorspellen en vergelijken van kinematica voor verschillende letselscenario’s.\nSIMSON, simulatiesoftware voor het voorspellen en vergelijken van kinematica voor verschillende letselscenario’s.\nMet SENSA zal kinematische data worden verzameld door verdachten, getuigen of onderzoekers scenario’s te laten nabootsen waarvan wordt geclaimd of vermoed dat ze tot het letsel hebben geleid. SIMSON gebruikt vervolgens SENSA's output om een breed bereik aan variaties van het gesimuleerde scenario te simuleren. Het is de bedoeling dat OpenTwin als output objectieve, transparante en makkelijk te interpreteren forensische rapporten levert over de biomechanische waarschijnlijkheid van verschillende scenario’s als oorzaak van letsel dat bij een kindje is gevonden.\nOpenTwin wordt een open platform, met daarin SENSA als open hardware als SIMSON als open software, ontwikkeld met gebruikers en partners in de strafrechtketen die belang hebben bij deze nieuwe forensische tool. Ontwerpeisen zijn o.a. dat het systeem modulair, betaalbaar, makkelijk te maken en intuïtief in gebruik is. Zo zal OpenTwin bijdragen aan veiligheid en gerechtigheid voor iedereen en eindelijk uitkomst bieden in de veel in rechtszalen gevoerde discussie of schudden tot letsel bij jonge kinderen kan leiden. Hiermee helpen wij, en dan ook jij, voorkomen dat schuldige daders ongestraft blijven en kinderen (opnieuw) kunnen mishandelen, maar ook dat onschuldige ouders hun kindje kwijtraken. En vooral beschermen we daarmee de kinderen; zowel tegen het terug geplaats worden bij daders als tegen het weggehaald worden bij onschuldige ouders.\nOnderzoeksteam & werkomgeving:\n- Je werkt nauw samen met de andere PhD ( zie onze andere vacature ), want jullie systemen moeten naadloos in elkaar passen.\nzie onze andere vacature\n- Jullie hebben een OpenSim technicus, onze werkplaats en onze ervaren constructeurs en adviseurs tot je beschikking.\n- Jullie worden in dit door NWO gefinancierde project ondersteund door onze internationale gebruikerscommissie met experts uit de hele strafrechtketen tot jullie beschikking (Politie, NFI, OM, rechters, forensisch artsen en biomechanici).

Zowel elektronica als mechanica. Voor het meten van kinematica en mogelijk ook oogdruk, bloeddruk, breinverplaatsing, bij voorkeur zonder enige vorm van, en anders een zo eenvoudig mogelijke variant van, optische motion capture.\n- Testopstellingen ontwikkelen voor gestandaardiseerd verifiëren en valideren van SENSA en OpenTwin en deze tests uitvoeren.\n- Dat alles als open hardware en open software met goede documentatie.\n- Uiteraard hoort bij een promotieplek ook dat je wetenschappelijke vaardigheden en een goed netwerk ontwikkelt, je onderzoeksresultaten publiceert in wetenschappelijke journals, helpt bij het begeleiden van afstudeerders (op jouw project) en af en toe ondersteunt bij onderwijs als er taken liggen die bij jou passen.\nFunctie-eisen:\n- Afgeronde universitaire Master in een relevant gebied, zoals werktuigbouwkunde, elektrotechniek, biomedical engineering, technical medicine, etc.\n- Ervaring met het systematisch ontwerpen van mechanica en meetelektronica.\n- Ervaring met het maken en assembleren van dergelijke systemen.\n- Ervaring met programmeren in MATLAB en/of Python.\n- Interesse in biomechanica en het forensisch veld.\n- Vaardig met meetsystemen voor kinematica, bewegingsanalyses etc.\n- Bekend met wetenschappelijke methoden voor het ontwerpen en testen van mechanische systemen en bij voorkeur ook met het gebruik van Git repositories.\n- In staat om samen te werken in een zeer interdisciplinair team, initiatief te nemen en resultaatgericht te werken.\n- Goede communicatieve vaardigheden met oog voor de forensische en maatschappelijke context, gevoeligheden en nuances die bij dit onderwerp horen.\n- Uitstekende mondelinge en schriftelijke beheersing van de Engelse en Nederlandse taal.\nTU Delft\nDe Technische Universiteit Delft heeft een sterk fundament.

Forensisch onderzoek moet uitwijzen wat er is gebeurd: is het kindje geschud of geslagen, of misschien per ongeluk gevallen? Er is echter nog veel onbekend over, bijv., bij welke krachten letsel bij deze kinderen optreedt. Hierdoor zijn er ook nog geen goede forensische tools om objectief van verschillende scenario’s te testen welke tot letsel kunnen leiden.<br><br><strong>Project OpenTwin:</strong><br>De Forensic BioMechanical Engineering groep heeft van NWO een subsidie gekregen om OpenTwin te ontwikkelen.

En zou je graag willen promoveren op een plek waar actuele zorgvraagstukken, wetenschappelijk onderzoek en een internationaal kennisnetwerk samenkomen? Bij de vakgroep Healthcare Governance (HCG) van Erasmus School of Health Policy & Management (ESHPM) zijn wij op zoek naar een gemotiveerde en enthousiaste promovendus die etnografisch onderzoek wil doen naar de rol van technologische ondersteuning in het bevorderen van samenredzaamheid in de zorg voor ouderen.\nProjectbeschrijving\nDe Nederlandse gezondheidszorg staat voor grote uitdagingen door de snel vergrijzende bevolking. Deze demografische verschuiving zorgt voor een toenemende zorgvraag en druk op professionele zorgverlening. Om de druk op deze formele zorg te verlichten, pleit de Nederlandse overheid voor een maatschappelijke transitie van ‘ouderenzorg’ naar ‘zorg voor ouderen’. Hierin worden ouderen gestimuleerd om zo lang mogelijk thuis te wonen en zorg in hun eigen omgeving te ontvangen, ondersteund door een actievere rol voor mantelzorgers. Hoewel de noodzaak van deze transitie door veel partijen wordt erkend, brengt deze ook grote uitdagingen met zich mee.

Are you curious how to combine and explore the synergy between Visualization and Process Mining? In this project we aim to transform the way we analyze and visualize complex processes.\nInformation\nThe field of process mining, a branch of business process management, revolves around discovering, analyzing, and optimizing business processes. It does so by extracting insights from event logs, structured records that capture sequences of activities, such as steps in a loan approval workflow, product purchases by customers, or patient journeys across hospitals. However, traditional process mining techniques focus primarily on control-flow, which describes the chain of activities. This singular focus often neglects other dimensions of processes, such as the time between activities and the time required for specific steps, the spatial distribution of tasks across locations, or the intricate relationships between resources and attributes involved in the processes. For example, in a supply chain scenario, understanding delays, warehouse locations, and inventory attributes is crucial, but often omitted in basic control-flow analysis. Process mining, as it stands today, is primarily based on computational techniques and algorithms to analyze and optimize processes. Methods such as process discovery, conformance checking, and performance analysis rely on algorithmic approaches to extract patterns, detect deviations, and identify inefficiencies from event logs. Although these techniques have proven effective in providing data-driven insights, they often fail to use visualization as a powerful means of interpretation and communication. Most process mining tools provide static and linear representations, such as process models (DFGs, BPMN) or Gantt charts, which are primarily suited for experts familiar with these abstractions. This limited use of visualization overlooks the potential for dynamic, interactive visual tools that can make complex process data accessible to a broader audience, enabling intuitive exploration and deeper understanding of multi-faceted process attributes, such as time, resources, and contextual dependencies and correlations.\nIn contrast, the field of visual analytics focuses on developing tools and techniques to support the interpretation of complex, multi-dimensional data. It provides concepts and techniques to explore and analyze event sequences, allowing patterns and anomalies to emerge intuitively. For example, visualizations such as timelines, Sankey diagrams, or network diagrams make it possible to uncover dependencies and bottlenecks in event sequences. Despite their shared goal of deriving actionable insights from event sequence data, process mining and visual analytics have largely operated in parallel, leaving significant opportunities for synergy unexplored.\nBy integrating the two domains, process mining can benefit from visual analytics’ expertise in handling multi-faceted data. Visualizations that incorporate temporal, spatial, and relational aspects can unlock deeper insights into processes. Conversely, visual analytics can leverage process mining techniques to enhance guidance and evaluation during data exploration.

You’ll collect and analyse data on conservation options - predator management, habitat configuration and measures for increased chick survival - and combine them in a spatially explicit Integrated Population Model to guide real conservation decisions, helping reverse the decline of the Netherlands’ national bird, the black-tailed godwit.\nJoin our team!\nWe seek a quantitative, ecology-minded PhD candidate to expand our state-of-the-art Bayesian Integrated Population Model (IPM) that synthesizes population counts, nest outcomes and survival across life stages. You will extend the IPM to become spatially explicit and link it to management options (e.g., land use, predator pressure food availability) to forecast population outcomes and guide policy for the black-tailed godwit in Southwest Friesland, the Netherlands.\nThis PhD builds on a long-running black-tailed godwit demography program in Friesland and is part of a large, joint conservation project between the University of Amsterdam (UvA) and the University of Groningen (RUG). You will work alongside and collaborate with two PhD students and several senior and postdoctoral researchers based at the University of Groningen, who study how predation and food supply shape chick growth and survival—providing rich, coordinated data streams for your models.\nYou are expected to be present at least one day per week at our shared meeting place - the BirdEyes centre in Leeuwarden, with preferably occasional visits to Groningen. Your first or second year in spring (March–June) will be predominantly field-based in Friesland; thereafter the emphasis shifts toward modelling, integration and scenario analyses.\nWhat are you going to do?\nTasks and responsibilities:\n- Conduct and help organize demographic fieldwork during part of the PhD;\n- Build, validate and document the spatially explicit IPM; maintain reproducible workflows;\n- Integrate multi-source data streams from other work packages (chick growth/condition, predation, habitat selection);\n- Design and analyze management scenarios with stakeholders;\n- Write scientific papers and present at conferences and project meetings;\n- Contribute to teaching at UvA (maximum 10% of time).\nYour profile\nWe are looking for someone with a strong motivation to conduct research in the field of animal population ecology and conservation. We’re keen to meet candidates who are excited to make quantitative modelling work count for conservation.\nYour experience and profile:\n- MSc (or nearly completed) in ecology, quantitative biology, environmental science, applied statistics, or a closely related field;\n- Fluent in spoken and written English;\n- Strong computational skills;\n- Some familiarity with population ecology, capture–mark–recapture, IPMs or state-space models;\n- An interest in wader ecology and conservation in an agroeconomical context;\n- An affinity for scientific writing;\n- Clear communicator with an interest in stakeholder-facing science;\n- Motivated to conduct fieldwork in a godwit population as part of a larger team;\n- A valid European driving license;\n- Experience with ecological fieldwork and/or handling and ringing birds is an advantage.\nOur offer\nWe offer you a temporary contract for 38 hours per week for the duration of 4 years (the initial contract will be for a period of 18 months and after satisfactory evaluation it will be extended with 30 months). The preferred starting date is 1 March 2026. This contract should lead to a dissertation (PhD thesis). We will draft an educational plan that includes attendance of courses and (international) meetings. We also expect you to assist in teaching undergraduates and master students. For this position the University Job Classification profile “Promovendus” (PhD candidate) applies. Your salary will be € 3,059 gross per month in the first year and will increase to € 3,881 in the final year, based on full-time employment of 38 hours per week. In addition, you will receive an 8% holiday allowance and 8.3% year-end allowance.\nThe\nCollective Labour Agreement of Universities of the Netherlands\nis applicable.\nBesides the salary and a vibrant and challenging environment at Science Park we offer you multiple fringe benefits:\n- 232 holiday hours per year (based on fulltime) and extra holidays between Christmas and 1 January;\n- a complete educational program for PhD students;\n- multiple courses on topics such as time management, handling stress and an online learning platform with 100+ different courses;\n- 7 weeks birth leave (partner leave) with 100% salary;\n- partly paid parental leave;\n- the possibility to set up a workplace at home;\n- a pension at ABP for which UvA pays two third part of the contribution;\n- the possibility to follow courses to learn Dutch;\n- help with registration at UvA- Housing for a studio or small apartment when you’re moving from abroad.\nAre you curious to read more about our extensive package of secondary employment benefits, take a look\nhere\n.\nWhere you will work\nThe\nInstitute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics\n(IBED) is one of eight research institutes of the Faculty of Science at the University of Amsterdam. The research at IBED aims to unravel how ecosystems function in all their complexity, and how they change due to natural processes and human activities. At its core lies an integrated systems approach to study biodiversity, ecosystems and the environment.

      "description_en": "Do you enjoy working as a PhD on search for the extremely rare process of\nttHH production\nin LHC Run-3 data? Or are you interested in focus on the reconstruction of two-Higgs decay channel into a pair of photons and a pair of b-quarks? We are delighted to offer 2 PhD positions at\nNikhef\n, where you will work for UvA.\nJoin Us!\nNikhef is the national institute for subatomic physics in the Netherlands. At Nikhef, approximately 220 physicists and 80 technical staff work together in an open and international scientific environment. Together they perform theoretical and experimental research in the fields of particle and astroparticle physics. Nikhef is a partnership between six major Dutch universities and NWO-I Foundation, the Institutes Organization of the Dutch Research Council (NWO). Among the research collaborations Nikhef participates in are the ALICE, ATLAS and LHCb experiments at CERN, the KM3NeT neutrino telescope in the Mediterranean, the Virgo gravitational waves interferometer in Pisa, the Xenon-nT dark matter experiment in Gran Sasso, the Pierre Auger cosmic ray observatory in Argentina, and the eEDM research programme in Groningen. There are also scientific groups on Theory, Physics Data Processing and Detector R&D. Nikhef avails over excellently equipped technical departments in mechanics, electronics and computing.\nThe Nikhef ATLAS group\nconsists of a total of 15 scientific staff, typically 5 postdocs and 15 PhD students. As a founding member of the ATLAS collaboration, the group has a long-term involvement in detector construction (the semiconductor tracker, barrel muon chambers, readout, alignment, and data acquisition). For the phase-2 upgrade (2027-2030), we will instrument and commission one of the end-caps of a new all-silicon inner tracking system (ITk) in Amsterdam, commission the High Granularity Timing Detector (HGTD), and develop the new universal readout system (FELIX) for ATLAS detector systems. The group also has a strong record in track reconstruction, flavour tagging algorithm development as well as physics data analysis, with a focus on Higgs boson physics, top quark physics, and searches for new physics signatures.\nThis is what you will do\nAfter the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012, one of the crucial future challenges for the LHC is to probe its most enigmatic property, the Higgs potential, which can manifest itself in LHC collisions through the production of Higgs boson pairs. These decays, which are 1000 times more rare than single Higgs production according to the Standard Model have not yet been observed. Observation of two-Higgs production is one the most important milestone for the LHC physics program, and will help constrain our knowledge of the Higgs potential, which has shaped the universe at its time of creation, and may hold strong clues about the existence of new physics beyond the Standard Model.\nPosition 1\nwill focus on the search for the extremely rare process of\nttHH production\nin LHC Run-3 data. This search will include all tt final states, and will include boosted final states. The analysis strategy is strongly focused on advanced machine learning techniques, developing attention-based transformer models that will directly classify events from the low-level data, rather than high-level objects, and which may ultimately include higher-level tasks such as Higgs boson mass regression for the analyzed data. The boosted object analysis will have a strong synergy with boosted analyses we are performing in other two-Higgs channels.\nThis position is co-supervised by prof. dr. Ivo van Vulpen, dr. Clara Nellist, and dr. Sascha Caron. The candidates is employed by the University of Amsterdam, is primarily based at Nikhef in Amsterdam\n.\nPosition 2\nwill focus on the reconstruction of two-Higgs decay channel into a pair of photons and a pair of b-quarks (\nHH\nà\nbb\nγγ\n) , which currently provides the tightest constraints, and on the\ncombined interpretation of all reconstructed diHiggs channels\n. Apart from the Run-3 diHiggs combination of all channels, which will provide the ultimate statement on diHiggs production that can be obtained with the LHC Run-3 data, a combination of single-Higgs, di-Higgs and triple-Higgs production measurements will allow to constrain the trilinear and quartic Higgs coupling, and thus the shape of the Higgs potential with unprecedented precision. In this position you will closely work together with PhD students involved in the main diHiggs channels (bbbb, bbττ and bbVV) for the combined interpretation and with a postdoc that is being recruited simultaneously that work on novel ML-based strategies to improve the precision of diHiggs combined interpretations.\nThis position is co-supervised by prof. dr. Wouter Verkerke, prof. dr. Tristan du Pree. The candidates is employed by the University of Amsterdam, is primarily based at Nikhef in Amsterdam\n.\nThe positions offered here are part of a NWO-funded physics program 'The potential of the Higgs boson', with prof. dr. Pamela Ferrari as principle investigator, which will ultimately comprise 7 PhD positions and 2 postdoc positions in the Nikhef ATLAS group in the period 2025-2030 all focused on the Higgs boson potential, complemented by 9 Nikhef staff scientists that offer supervision, networking opportunities and a specialized training program in data analysis techniques and Higgs boson physics.\nWhat we ask of you\nWe are looking for PhD candidates with an (almost) completed Master degree in high-energy physics or in a closely related field. The ideal candidate has a strong interest in data analysis, has good software skills (Python, C++, ROOT) and has (some) research experience in experimental particle physics. Experience with machine learning algorithms and software is desirable but not required.\nThis is what we offer you\nWe offer a temporary contract for 38 hours per week for the duration of 4 years (the initial contract will be for a period of 18 months and after satisfactory evaluation it will be extended for a total duration of 4 years). The gross monthly salary, based on 38 hours per week ranges between € 3,059 to € 3,881 (Scale P). This does not include 8% holiday allowance and 8,3% year-end allowance. The UFO profile PhD candidate is applicable. A favourable tax agreement, the ‘30% ruling’, may apply to non-Dutch applicants.\nThe preferred starting date is to be discussed. This employment should lead to a dissertation (PhD thesis). We will draft an educational plan that includes attendance of courses and (international) meetings. We also expect you to assist in teaching undergraduates and master students. During the doctoral program there is the possibility for extended stays at CERN, up to a total of 1 year.\nThe\nCollective Labour Agreement of Universities of the Netherlands\nis applicable.\nYou will work in this team\nThe\nFaculty of Science\nhas a student body of around 8,000, as well as 1,800 members of staff working in education, research or support services. Researchers and students at the Faculty of Science are fascinated by every aspect of how the world works, be it elementary particles, the birth of the universe or the functioning of the brain.\nThe I\nnstitute of Physics (IoP)\nof the University of Amsterdam is located in the center of the Amsterdam Science Park. The IoP – as part of the Faculty of Science –is housed in a modern building with excellent labs and technical facilities. Surrounded by several national research institutes and with our partners at the Vrije Universiteit (VU) Amsterdam, the institute is part of a strong physics center of international standing.\nNikhef\nis the national institute for subatomic physics in the Netherlands.

Or are you interested in focus on the reconstruction of two-Higgs decay channel into a pair of photons and a pair of b-quarks? We are delighted to offer 2 PhD positions at <a href=\"https://www.nikhef.nl/\">Nikhef</a>, where you will work for UvA.<br><br><strong>Join Us!</strong><br>Nikhef is the national institute for subatomic physics in the Netherlands. At Nikhef, approximately 220 physicists and 80 technical staff work together in an open and international scientific environment. Together they perform theoretical and experimental research in the fields of particle and astroparticle physics. Nikhef is a partnership between six major Dutch universities and NWO-I Foundation, the Institutes Organization of the Dutch Research Council (NWO). Among the research collaborations Nikhef participates in are the ALICE, ATLAS and LHCb experiments at CERN, the KM3NeT neutrino telescope in the Mediterranean, the Virgo gravitational waves interferometer in Pisa, the Xenon-nT dark matter experiment in Gran Sasso, the Pierre Auger cosmic ray observatory in Argentina, and the eEDM research programme in Groningen. There are also scientific groups on Theory, Physics Data Processing and Detector R&amp;D. Nikhef avails over excellently equipped technical departments in mechanics, electronics and computing. <strong>The Nikhef ATLAS group </strong>consists of a total of 15 scientific staff, typically 5 postdocs and 15 PhD students. As a founding member of the ATLAS collaboration, the group has a long-term involvement in detector construction (the semiconductor tracker, barrel muon chambers, readout, alignment, and data acquisition). For the phase-2 upgrade (2027-2030), we will instrument and commission one of the end-caps of a new all-silicon inner tracking system (ITk) in Amsterdam, commission the High Granularity Timing Detector (HGTD), and develop the new universal readout system (FELIX) for ATLAS detector systems. The group also has a strong record in track reconstruction, flavour tagging algorithm development as well as physics data analysis, with a focus on Higgs boson physics, top quark physics, and searches for new physics signatures.<br><br><strong>This is what you will do</strong><br>After the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012, one of the crucial future challenges for the LHC is to probe its most enigmatic property, the Higgs potential, which can manifest itself in LHC collisions through the production of Higgs boson pairs. These decays, which are 1000 times more rare than single Higgs production according to the Standard Model have not yet been observed. Observation of two-Higgs production is one the most important milestone for the LHC physics program, and will help constrain our knowledge of the Higgs potential, which has shaped the universe at its time of creation, and may hold strong clues about the existence of new physics beyond the Standard Model.<br><strong>Position 1</strong> will focus on the search for the extremely rare process of <strong>ttHH production</strong> in LHC Run-3 data. This search will include all tt final states, and will include boosted final states. The analysis strategy is strongly focused on advanced machine learning techniques, developing attention-based transformer models that will directly classify events from the low-level data, rather than high-level objects, and which may ultimately include higher-level tasks such as Higgs boson mass regression for the analyzed data. The boosted object analysis will have a strong synergy with boosted analyses we are performing in other two-Higgs channels. <em>This position is co-supervised by prof. dr. Ivo van Vulpen, dr. Clara Nellist, and dr. Sascha Caron. The candidates is employed by the University of Amsterdam, is primarily based at Nikhef in Amsterdam<strong>.</strong> </em><br><br><strong>Position 2</strong> will focus on the reconstruction of two-Higgs decay channel into a pair of photons and a pair of b-quarks (<strong>HH</strong><strong>à</strong><strong>bb</strong><strong>γγ</strong>) , which currently provides the tightest constraints, and on the <strong>combined interpretation of all reconstructed diHiggs channels</strong>. Apart from the Run-3 diHiggs combination of all channels, which will provide the ultimate statement on diHiggs production that can be obtained with the LHC Run-3 data, a combination of single-Higgs, di-Higgs and triple-Higgs production measurements will allow to constrain the trilinear and quartic Higgs coupling, and thus the shape of the Higgs potential with unprecedented precision. In this position you will closely work together with PhD students involved in the main diHiggs channels (bbbb, bbττ and bbVV) for the combined interpretation and with a postdoc that is being recruited simultaneously that work on novel ML-based strategies to improve the precision of diHiggs combined interpretations. <em>This position is co-supervised by prof. dr. Wouter Verkerke, prof. dr. Tristan du Pree. The candidates is employed by the University of Amsterdam, is primarily based at Nikhef in Amsterdam<strong>.</strong></em><br><br>The positions offered here are part of a NWO-funded physics program 'The potential of the Higgs boson', with prof. dr.

In this project TU/e works together with Sleep Center Kempenhaeghe and Takeda to improve long-term, low-obtrusive monitoring of the sleep disorder narcolepsy and facilitate management of daytime complaints using digital health technology.\nInformation\nNarcolepsy is a chronic sleep disorder that typically imposes a substantial burden on those affected. People with narcolepsy often experience a broad range of symptoms, such as excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, and fragmented nocturnal sleep. Moreover, the spectrum of narcolepsy also includes symptoms that manifest more during daytime such as automatic behavior, cognitive impairments or mood disturbances. Symptoms greatly vary among patients and day-to-day variance can be considerable. Available narcolepsy questionnaires do not cover the full symptom spectrum and do not - or only retrospectively - capture symptom variability. Therefore, there is a clinical need for tools to monitor narcolepsy-related symptoms over time, to assess, describe, and predict the associated burden in daily life and evaluate the effect of treatment on everyday behaviors and experiences during sleep and wake.\nM-Health offers the opportunity to monitor user experiences during their daily routine over prolonged time, in a scalable manner. Sleep Medicine Center Kempenhaeghe developed the Narcolepsy Monitor, a digital research tool to gain insight into both the individual and synergetic burden of 20 narcolepsy symptoms over time. In this project, we aim to detailly expand our knowledge of the narcolepsy symptom spectrum, gain a better understanding of the inter-relation between patients’ symptoms and lived experiences, and advance longitudinal monitoring of disease burden. A better understanding of the symptoms and their dynamics over time as well as interindividual variability in the ecologies of specific symptoms can help to tailor treatment to the individual patient.\nTo facilitate the monitoring of narcolepsy-related symptoms with an m-Health application, it is important to understand which symptoms should be logged, and with which frequency, to map and better understand patients' lived experiences. Moreover, to mitigate user burden, monitoring should occur as minimally obtrusive and as engaging for a large audience as possible. Unobtrusive sensor technologies could complement self-reported data and may reduce the sampling frequency of self-reports.\nThe current project has three main aims, contributing to monitoring narcolepsy with an mHealth application:\n- Analyzing the Narcolepsy Monitor database to identify symptom clusters and to quantify dynamics of longitudinal disease burden. We will investigate associations between symptoms experienced by narcolepsy patients and assess temporal dynamics in the symptoms from a 24/7 perspective. To this end, we will analyze variations in symptom severity within days, across days, weeks, and explore variance over longer timeframes such as months. This will help us learn about which symptoms to monitor and at what time resolution.\n- Advancing insights about the integration of sensor data by analyzing self-reported data augmented with wearable data obtained through a new data collection campaign.\n- Understanding patient’s and healthcare professionals’ preferences in patient monitoring and co-creating and analyzing dashboards tailored to the needs of the different user groups (patients and healthcare professionals).\nIn this project, you will work in a multidisciplinary team which combines expertise on sleep medicine in general and narcolepsy in particular, together with longitudinal monitoring and digital health technology. This research will be conducted in both the Advanced Sleep Monitoring research group (Biomedical Diagnostics lab, Electrical Engineering) and the Human Technology interaction group (Industrial Engineering & Innovation Sciences) at the TU/e. You will work in close collaboration with Takeda and Sleep Medicine Center Kempenhaeghe. Kempenhaeghe is a tertiary expertise center for sleep medicine, with specific experience with diagnosis and treatment of narcolepsy patients. Takeda is an international pharmaceutical company which has a narcolepsy medication in development.",

      "description_en": "The faculty of Science and the Schneider group within the Leiden Institute of Chemistry are looking for a PhD candidate to join us in the Laboratory of 2D materials.\n“Ion transport and synthesis of two dimensional nanopores and nanoporous membranes”\nDisciplines: ion transport chemistry and physics, nanopores, energy devices, fuel cells, osmotic energy, membrane chemistry and physics, organic chemistry\nAbout the Project 2DPolymembrane\nCurrent separation technology is crucial for many aspects of human life and accounts for ~15% of the world’s energy consumption. Additionally, in the development of next-generation power solutions based on fuel cells and ion batteries, the membrane is an essential component that directly determines device efficiency. While the particle flow through separation columns is directional at the atomistic scale, undirected Brownian motion dominates in state-of-the-art membranes. 2D membranes have the potential to overcome this intrinsic deficiency and shift the paradigm of particle transport from disordered Brownian motion to unidirectional flow. In the project we will develop 2D polymer heterostructure membranes (2DHMs) combined with functionalized graphene. They offer ultimate thinness (leading to shortest diffusion lengths), precision pore geometry/size (resulting in high size-selectivity, even for hydrogen isotopes), and high functionality (fostering chemical/charge selectivity and ionic gating), making them ideal membrane materials to realize selective and unidirectional ion transport. We will combine theory and prediction, chemical design, and on-water/liquid surface synthesis, as well as in-situ ion transport investigations to develop robust 2DHMs. We will synthesize 2DHMs in the form of horizontal and vertical heterostructures, for which reliable structure property correlations will be established. We will take advantage of lattice vibrations, nuclear quantum, and electrochemical effects, and consequently reformulate classical diffusion theory to consider these game changers. As a result, we will achieve innovative 2DHMs for selective proton and ion transport with high permeance, laying the foundations for the next-generation membrane technologies. 2DPolymembrane will unlock the unique opportunities of 2DHMs for innovative energy device integrations (proton/aqueous metal batteries, fuel cells, and reverse osmotic power generators), where the merits of ultrathin precision 2DHMs will result in the highest selectivity and highest particle flow, and thus a fundamental device performance beyond the state-of-art.\nThe PhD students will be supervised by Grégory Schneider (Leiden Institute of Chemistry), and work in close collaboration with the teams at the Max Planck Institute of Microstructure Physics (Prof. Xinliang Feng) and at the Dresden University of Technology (Prof. Thomas Heine).\nAbout the ERC Synergy Grant Poly2DMembrane\nSee:\nEuropean grants for research on ultrathin membranes and the biological clock in bacteria - Leiden University\nSeparation processes are essential in our daily lives, from drug development and purification to cleaning wastewater. These processes, however, use a lot of energy due to the thicknesses of the membranes, together with the random movement of particles. The 2DPolyMembrane project is working to change that paradigm. By developing special 2D membranes that allow particles to flow in a single direction, this project could significantly improve the efficiency of separation technologies.\nAbout the University\nLeiden University is one of Europe’s leading international research universities.\nThanks to its committed and inspired staff and students, the university enjoys a leading role in academic research and education. Leiden also scores very well every year in prominent rankings. This means that, to maintain our position, the bar is set very high.

      "description_en": "Welkom bij de Universiteit Maastricht!\nBen jij een gepassioneerde onderzoeker met een hart voor innovatie en AI? Wil je bijdragen aan het ontwikkelen en evalueren van een innovatie in de huisartsenzorg? De afdeling Huisartsgeneeskunde van de Universiteit Maastricht zoekt een promovendus om praktijkgericht onderzoek te verrichten.\nPromovendus - Infectieziekten als casus voor data gedreven verbetering in de huisartsenpraktijk\n- Ons doel: De huisartsenzorg verbeteren met behulp van kunstmatige intelligentie, voor betere diagnostiek, datakwaliteit en patiëntenzorg.\nOns doel:\n- Jouw collega’s: Huisartsen, onderzoekers en patiënten die samen werken aan de huisartsenzorg van de toekomst.\nJouw collega’s:\nHuisartsen verzamelen dagelijks grote hoeveelheden waardevolle patiëntgegevens, deels gestructureerd en gestandaardiseerd, maar een substantieel deel bestaat uit vrije tekst uit consultverslagen. Deze ongestructureerde data wordt momenteel nog maar beperkt benut. Dankzij de opkomst van AI, en met name krachtige taalmodellen zoals BERT en GPT, ontstaan er nieuwe kansen om deze informatie effectief om te zetten in praktische ondersteuning bij diagnostiek, prognose en datakwaliteit. Dit onderzoeksproject richt zich daarbij op infectieziekten, zoals urineweginfectie en longontsteking - aandoeningen die tot de meest voorkomende klachten in de huisartspraktijk behoren.\nBinnen dit project onderzoek je hoe AI een rol kan spelen in het verbeteren van de huisartsenzorg bij infectieziekten. Je werkt aan het ontwikkelen en valideren van AI-modellen voor diagnostiek en risicovoorspelling, en onderzoekt hoe deze technologie kan bijdragen aan betere registratie en datakwaliteit. Tegelijkertijd breng je in kaart hoe huisartsen en patiënten aankijken tegen het gebruik van AI in de dagelijkse praktijk. Je maakt gebruik van rijke, bestaande huisartsendata en werkt samen met meerdere academische netwerken verspreid over Nederland, samen goed voor gegevens van maar liefst 1,5 miljoen patiënten.\nVanaf 2025 is de vakgroep Huisartsgeneeskunde bovendien gestart met het inrichten van een academische werkplaats huisartsenzorg. Het doel van deze werkplaats is het ontwikkelen van nieuwe kennis en het gebruik daarvan in de praktijk te bevorderen, via een betere samen- en wisselwerking tussen huisartsenorganisaties en universiteit. De vakgroep is daarin actief vanuit twee fysieke ‘hubs’: Maastricht en Eindhoven. Deze dynamische omgeving biedt daarmee extra kansen jezelf tijdens dit promotietraject te ontwikkelen, en werken is vanuit beide locaties mogelijk.\nDoor praktijkgericht onderzoek te combineren met technologische innovatie, draag je bij aan de veilige en verantwoorde inzet van AI in de eerstelijnszorg. Dit project biedt dan ook een unieke kans om medische inhoud te combineren met technologische innovatie. Je werkt in een maatschappelijk relevant domein, met directe impact op de dagelijkse zorg. Samen met zorgverleners, patiënten en onderzoekers bouw je aan de huisartsenzorg van de toekomst.\nWat ga je doen?\n- Het ontwikkelen en valideren van AI-modellen op basis van gestructureerde en ongestructureerde huisartsdata\n- Het uitvoeren van kwalitatief onderzoek naar de perspectieven van huisartsen en patiënten op het gebruik van AI\n- Het samenwerken met onderzoekers, data scientists, zorgprofessionals en netwerkpartners in een multidisciplinaire setting\n- Het vertalen van onderzoeksresultaten naar praktische aanbevelingen voor zorg, beleid en onderwijs\n- Het schrijven van wetenschappelijke artikelen en rapportages over de bevindingen\nBen jij klaar om koers te zetten voor de komende jaren? Dan ontmoeten we je graag.\nWat jij meebrengt\nHet gaat ons niet om vinkjes, maar om jouw motivatie, leergierigheid en aanpak. Herken jij jezelf hierin?\n- Een afgeronde universitaire masteropleiding biomedische technologie, biomedische wetenschappen, (technische) geneeskunde, gezondheidswetenschappen, of gelijke strekking;\n- Interesse in innovaties in de huisartspraktijk, big data en AI/LLM. Ervaring met deze technologieën is een pré.\n- Affiniteit met wetenschappelijk onderzoek, zowel kwalitatief als kwantitatief;\n- Goede organisatorische en communicatieve vaardigheden, in zowel Nederlands als Engels;\n- Een zelfstandige, nauwkeurige werkhouding én plezier in samenwerken met een interdisciplinair team.\n- Ervaring met wetenschappelijk schrijven is een pré.\nWat je van ons mag verwachten\nBij de Universiteit Maastricht werk je in een internationale, open en betrokken omgeving. We bieden:\n- Een jaarcontract, bij wederzijdse tevredenheid wordt het contract verlengd met 3 jaar.\n- Een bruto salaris tussen €3.059 en €3.881 bruto per maand (bij een fulltime dienstverband van 38 uur per week), exclusief 8% vakantiegeld en een 8,3% eindejaarsuitkering.\n- 29 vakantiedagen (op basis van fulltime), vier extra vrije dagen, en de mogelijkheid om 12 extra dagen op te bouwen via compensatie-uren.\n- Flexibele werktijden, een thuiswerkvergoeding en hybride werken.\n- Vrijheid en ruimte om je werk zelfstandig in te richten en je eigen ideeën te ontwikkelen.\n- Een hechte community van collega’s waarmee je nauw samenwerkt.\n- Een goede pensioenregeling via het ABP, bedrijfsfitness en toegang tot een uitgebreid sportaanbod.\n- Een inspirerende werkomgeving in het hart van Europa.\nOver de Faculty of Health, Medicine and Life Sciences (FHML)\nFHML werkt aan gezondheid in de breedste zin van het woord: van molecuul tot mens, en van gezondheidszorg tot preventie. We leiden zorgprofessionals en onderzoekers op binnen innovatieve onderwijsprogramma’s, en doen baanbrekend onderzoek op het gebied van gezondheid en welzijn. Als onderdeel van het Maastricht UMC+ (MUMC+) vormt onze internationale en interdisciplinaire gemeenschap een unieke samenwerking tussen universiteit en academisch ziekenhuis, waar onderwijs, onderzoek en zorg samenkomen.\nCAPHRI\nOnze vakgroep is onderdeel van onderzoeksinstituut CAPHRI, dat zich inzet voor betere gezondheid door innovatief, praktijkgericht en maatschappelijk relevant onderzoek. CAPHRI verbindt wetenschap en samenleving via participatief onderzoek binnen de publieke en eerstelijnszorg en persoonsgerichte langdurige zorg. De vakgroep huisartsgeneeskunde heeft wetenschappelijke speerpunten: Huisarts & Diagnostiek, Huisarts & Digitale Zorg en Samen beslissen & interprofessioneel samenwerken. We verrichten onderzoek dat Bruikbare Wetenschap voor de praktijk van de huisarts oplevert.

Join us on our journey to ensure Safe Operation of Military Systems.\nJob description\nJoin the Corrosion Technology and Electrochemistry (CTE) group, part of the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, in close collaboration with the Netherlands Defence Academy. The CTE group is a dynamic team of researchers, including PhD candidates, postdocs, and faculty members. Our group focuses on understanding and mitigating corrosion processes, and on the development of electrocatalysts and electrochemical sensors through the synthesis of materials and the use of advanced electrochemical methods and surface analysis techniques. We aim to deepen the fundamental knowledge of electrochemistry and surface science and translate this into practical, sustainable solutions for energy and materials applications.\nIncreasingly strict performance requirements for components lead to new material combinations and potential corrosion problems. The most dangerous of these are highly localized. Localized corrosion under a coating is however typically difficult to detect visually. Electrochemical Noise (EN) can detect this at an early stage and is not limited by geometric characteristics. Moreover, EN measures passively and continuously, making it very suitable for permanent monitoring or as an accelerated testing method. The effectiveness of EN depends on effective data analysis. Until now, specific EN fingerprints of localized corrosion are determined manually. This is a tedious procedure that requires considerable expert knowledge. Artificial intelligence or machine learning (AI/ML) models can offer a solution here.\nThis project aims to determine to what extent AI/ML models based on electrochemical sensor data are able to identify and quantify local forms of corrosion. We are looking for a skilled PhD researcher to investigate these models, together with the Netherlands Defence Academy. Your work as a PhD researcher involves the following:\n- Determining the required discrimination ability for classification and quantification of corrosion phenomena, e.g. differences and similarities in data between crevice- and different forms of pitting corrosion.\n- Investigating which types of AI/ML models can meet these requirements.\n- (Further) developing suitable AI/ML models.\n- Investigating which requirements the training data for the AI/ML models must meet, including type, quantity, and number of corrosion classes.\n- Performing laboratory experiments to validate the corrosion classification and -quantification for representative forms of corrosion that typically cause problems in military systems.\n- Further validation on field data from actual military systems.\nTU Delft (Delft University of Technology)\nDelft University of Technology is built on strong foundations. As creators of the world-famous Dutch waterworks and pioneers in biotech, TU Delft is a top international university combining science, engineering and design. It delivers world class results in education, research and innovation to address challenges in the areas of energy, climate, mobility, health and digital society.

        "description": "<strong><em>Would you love to apply Data Science to Military Corrosion Technology? Join us on our journey to ensure Safe Operation of Military Systems.</em></strong><br><br><strong>Job description</strong><br>Join the Corrosion Technology and Electrochemistry (CTE) group, part of the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, in close collaboration with the Netherlands Defence Academy. The CTE group is a dynamic team of researchers, including PhD candidates, postdocs, and faculty members. Our group focuses on understanding and mitigating corrosion processes, and on the development of electrocatalysts and electrochemical sensors through the synthesis of materials and the use of advanced electrochemical methods and surface analysis techniques. We aim to deepen the fundamental knowledge of electrochemistry and surface science and translate this into practical, sustainable solutions for energy and materials applications.<br><br>Increasingly strict performance requirements for components lead to new material combinations and potential corrosion problems. The most dangerous of these are highly localized. Localized corrosion under a coating is however typically difficult to detect visually. Electrochemical Noise (EN) can detect this at an early stage and is not limited by geometric characteristics. Moreover, EN measures passively and continuously, making it very suitable for permanent monitoring or as an accelerated testing method. The effectiveness of EN depends on effective data analysis. Until now, specific EN fingerprints of localized corrosion are determined manually. This is a tedious procedure that requires considerable expert knowledge. Artificial intelligence or machine learning (AI/ML) models can offer a solution here.<br><br>This project aims to determine to what extent AI/ML models based on electrochemical sensor data are able to identify and quantify local forms of corrosion. We are looking for a skilled PhD researcher to investigate these models, together with the Netherlands Defence Academy. Your work as a PhD researcher involves the following:<br><ol> <li>Determining the required discrimination ability for classification and quantification of corrosion phenomena, e.g. differences and similarities in data between crevice- and different forms of pitting corrosion.</li> <li>Investigating which types of AI/ML models can meet these requirements.</li> <li>(Further) developing suitable AI/ML models.</li> <li>Investigating which requirements the training data for the AI/ML models must meet, including type, quantity, and number of corrosion classes.</li> <li>Performing laboratory experiments to validate the corrosion classification and -quantification for representative forms of corrosion that typically cause problems in military systems.</li> <li>Further validation on field data from actual military systems.</li>\n</ol>\n<br><strong>Job requirements </strong><br>Job requirements:<br><ul> <li>MSc degree in Materials Science, Metallurgy, Mechanical Engineering, Chemical Engineering or a related field.</li> <li>Proficiency with Data Science techniques.</li> <li>Excellent analytical skills, initiative, inventiveness, curiosity, diligence, and critical thinking.</li> <li>Ability to work with scientific and industrial partners.</li> <li>Strong communication skills (high English proficiency), team player, and good social behaviour.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>The following will make you stand out:<br><ul> <li>Creative, open-minded, and proactive researcher.</li> <li>Excellent experimental, analytical, and problem-solving skills.</li> <li>Self-driven attitude, creativity and autonomy.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>Important note: due to the specific nature of the subject, this vacancy is only applicable for Dutch and/or EU/NATO nationalities.

      "description_en": "Join our ERC SPHINX Team to model how climate risks ripple through housing markets. Help uncover when homes become stranded assets and fuel systemic impacts. Help shaping climate resilient policies!\nJob description\nThis 4-year fully funded PhD position is part of the ERC Consolidator project “Systemic physical climate risk in complex adaptive economies” (SPHINX). The SPHINX-research program is made possible thanks to a 2-million-euro grant from the European Research Council.\nBackground:\nGlobally, climate change already manifests via physical risks – damages from floods, storms, wildfires, heatwaves, droughts, and sea-level rise. Concerns are rising that these risks may become systemic, when local damages to one element cannot be contained and adversely affect the entire socio-economic system. Usually, physical climate risk assessments overlay hazard probability, exposure and vulnerability. These future damage estimates linearly extrapolate historic data, assuming that markets efficiently capitalize full information about climate risks and adjust gradually, economic actors have perfect future insight, and socio-economic systems will react to and price unprecedented climate-induced hazards as they did in the past. This approach is criticized for underestimating the true costs of climate change (e.g., at just 1-3% of GDP loss even under severe scenarios), impeding climate action. In contrast, analysis of systemic risks embraces complex interactions among elements/agents, adjusting expectations, mechanisms of contagion dynamics, feedbacks, and non-linear tipping. The SPHINX research program aims to fundamentally advance simulation methods and consolidate novel data to understand how systemic physical climate risks emerge in the socio-economic system, and to explore strategies to curtail their spiraling costs. The project focuses on Europe, with a detailed analysis of three selected case-study regions. Methodologically, SPHINX embraces five pillars, ranging from data collection to agent-based and computable general equilibrium modeling, led by five team members. The first three pillars concern the development of computational agent-based models to explore three different channels of risk propagation with a focus on the triggers of systemic risks. The current PhD position aims to advance assessments of physical climate risks for governments, including the emergence of moral hazard and inequality in the allocation of climate adaptation funding, as well as collateral damage to their budgets.\nJob description:\nThe successful candidate will work within the SPHINX research team to explore how governments balance economic development objectives with adaptation to accelerating physical climate risks, as households-voters decide where to live given their preferences for public adaptation. To explore the emergence of moral hazard and fiscal strain for governments under shifting climate risks, the candidate will develop an agent-based model grounded in the Tiebout theory and supported by data, including data on public preferences for allocating adaptation funds. During this 4-year-long project, the PhD student will build on the latest progress in economic research on changes in governmental debt and collateral fiscal damages, and instances of moral hazard and loss of creditworthiness for governments facing escalating climate risks. Connecting the mutually dependent decisions of governments to provide and fund public adaptation, and the location choices of diverse private actors in an agent-based model will be essential here. This modeling effort will benefit from the behavioral data on expectations elicited via tailored household and firm surveys (carried out by another team member) and other spatial and physical climate risk data. The goal of this agent-based modeling is to identify conditions under which risk contagion causes regional decline, and the roots of changing inequality based on how local governments decide on the level of public adaptation provision contingent on both households’ preferences for it and the availability of sufficient tax-based governmental budgets to afford it.\nTU Delft (Delft University of Technology)\nDelft University of Technology is built on strong foundations.

      "description_zh": "加入我们的 ERC SPHINX 团队，模拟气候风险如何影响房地产市场。帮助发现房屋何时成为搁浅资产并加剧系统性影响。帮助制定适应气候变化的政策！\n职位描述\n这个为期 4 年的全额资助博士职位是 ERC Consolidator 项目“复杂适应性经济中的系统性物理气候风险”(SPHINX) 的一部分。 SPHINX 研究计划的实现得益于欧洲研究委员会 200 万欧元的资助。\n背景：\n在全球范围内，气候变化已经通过物理风险显现出来——洪水、风暴、野火、热浪、干旱和海平面上升造成的损害。人们越来越担心，当某一要素的局部损害无法得到遏制并对整个社会经济体系产生不利影响时，这些风险可能会变得系统性。通常，物理气候风险评估涵盖灾害概率、暴露度和脆弱性。这些未来损害估计线性推断历史数据，假设市场有效地利用有关气候风险的完整信息并逐步调整，经济参与者具有完美的未来洞察力，社会经济系统将像过去一样对前所未有的气候引发的灾害做出反应并定价。这种方法受到批评，因为它低估了气候变化的真实成本（例如，即使在严峻的情况下，GDP 损失也仅为 1-3%），阻碍了气候行动。相比之下，系统性风险的分析包括要素/因素之间复杂的相互作用、调整预期、传染动力学机制、反馈和非线性提示。 SPHINX研究计划旨在从根本上推进模拟方法并整合新数据，以了解系统性物理气候风险如何在社会经济系统中出现，并探索遏制其不断上升的成本的策略。该项目重点关注欧洲，对三个选定的案例研究地区进行了详细分析。从方法上讲，SPHINX 拥有五个支柱，从数据收集到基于代理和可计算的一般均衡建模，由五名团队成员领导。前三个支柱涉及基于计算代理的模型的开发，以探索风险传播的三种不同渠道，重点关注系统性风险的触发因素。目前的博士职位旨在推进对政府实际气候风险的评估，包括气候适应资金分配中道德风险和不平等的出现，以及对其预算的附带损害。\n职位描述：\n成功的候选人将在 SPHINX 研究团队中工作，探索政府如何在经济发展目标与适应加速的自然气候风险之间取得平衡，因为家庭选民根据他们对公共适应的偏好来决定居住在哪里。为了探讨气候变化风险下政府出现的道德风险和财政压力，候选人将开发一个基于蒂博特理论并由数据支持的基于代理的模型，包括公众分配适应资金偏好的数据。在这个为期四年的项目中，博士生将利用经济研究的最新进展，研究政府债务和附带财政损失的变化，以及面临不断升级的气候风险的政府的道德风险和信用丧失的实例。在基于代理的模型中，将政府相互依赖的提供和资助公共适应的决策与不同私人参与者的位置选择联系起来至关重要。这项建模工作将受益于通过定制的家庭和公司调查（由另一名团队成员进行）得出的预期行为数据以及其他空间和物理气候风险数据。这种基于主体的模型的目标是确定风险传染导致区域衰退的条件，以及不平等变化的根源，具体取决于地方政府如何根据家庭的偏好以及是否有足够的基于税收的政府预算来决定公共适应措施的水平。\nTU Delft（代尔夫特理工大学）\n代尔夫特理工大学有着坚实的基础。作为举世闻名的荷兰水厂的创建者和生物技术的先驱，代尔夫特理工大学是一所集科学、工程和设计于一体的顶尖国际大学。它在教育、研究和创新方面提供世界一流的成果，以应对能源、气候、流动性、健康和数字社会领域的挑战。几代人以来，我们的工程师已被证明是商业和社会环境中的企业家问题解决者。\n在代尔夫特理工大学，我们将多样性视为我们的核心之一\n价值观\n并且我们积极地\n参与\n成为一所让您有宾至如归且能够蓬勃发展的大学。我们重视不同的观点和品质。我们相信这会让我们的工作更具创新性，让代尔夫特理工大学社区更加充满活力，让世界更加公正。我们共同想象、发明和创造利用技术对全球范围产生积极影响的解决方案。这就是我们邀请您申请的原因。您的申请将得到公平的考虑。\n挑战。改变。影响\n技术、政策与管理学院\nTPM 学院为解决能源转型、流动性、数字化、水管理和（网络）安全等复杂的技术社会问题做出了重要贡献。 TPM 凭借其在技术、社会和政策交叉领域的出色教育和研究做到了这一点。我们结合了工程、社会科学以及人文学科的见解。 TPM 开发稳健的模型和设计，面向国际，并拥有广泛的知识机构、公司、社会组织和政府网络。\n点击\n这里\n访问技术、政策与管理学院网站。\n雇佣条件\n博士生聘用期原则上为4年，但采用2份聘用合同的形式。最初的 1.5 年合同，并在 15 个月内进行正式的进展/不进展评估。如果一切顺利且满足性能要求，接下来将签订剩余 2.5 年的附加合同。\n工资和福利符合荷兰大学集体劳动协议，从第一年到第四年，基于全职合同（38小时），每月毛额从3059欧元增加到3881欧元，另加8%的假期津贴和8.3%的年终奖金。\n作为一名博士候选人，您将被代尔夫特理工大学研究生院录取。代尔夫特理工大学研究生院提供了一个鼓舞人心的研究环境，拥有一支优秀的导师、学术人员和导师团队。博士教育计划旨在培养您的可转移、学科相关和研究技能。\n代尔夫特理工大学提供可定制的薪酬方案、健康保险折扣以及每月的工作成本缴款。可以安排灵活的工作时间。\n您需要搬到荷兰来做这份工作吗？代尔夫特理工大学致力于让您的搬迁尽可能顺利！人力资源单位，\n来到代尔夫特服务\n，在其网站上提供信息以帮助您准备搬迁。此外，“来到代尔夫特服务”还组织活动来帮助您在荷兰定居，并扩展您在代尔夫特的（社交）网络。一个\n双轨制职业计划\n可以为您的随行伴侣在荷兰寻找工作提供支持。\n附加信息\n有关该职位的更多信息，请联系：T.Filatova 教授、博士，电子邮件：\nt.filatova@tudelft.nl\n，网页：\nhttps://www.sc3.center/\n。\n2025 年 11 月 23 日\n通过申请按钮并上传以下文件：\n- 你的动机信。\n- 你的简历。\n- 出版物或软件输出列表（如果适用）。\n- 2 名裁判员的联系方式。\n您可以向 T.Filatova 教授博士提出申请。\n请仅使用在线系统进行申请；通过电子邮件发送的申请将不予考虑。\n在代尔夫特理工大学攻读博士学位需要一定水平的英语水平，以确保候选人能够良好地沟通和互动、参加英语授课的博士教育课程、撰写科学文章和期末论文。欲了解更多详情，请查看\n研究生院入学要求\n。\n请注意：\n- 您可以在线申请。我们不会处理通过电子邮件和/或邮寄发送的申请。\n- 作为知识安全的一部分，代尔夫特理工大学在人员招聘过程中进行风险评估。除其他外，我们这样做是为了防止敏感知识和技术的不必要转移。评估基于候选人自己提供的信息，例如他们的动机信和简历，并在选拔过程的最后阶段进行。当评估结果是否定的时，候选人将被告知。风险评估背景下的个人数据处理是在 GDPR 的法律基础上进行的：为了公共利益执行公共任务。您可以在我们有关知识安全的网站上找到有关此评估的更多信息。\n知识安全。\n- 请不要联系我们寻求主动提供的服务。",

        "description": "<strong><em>Join our ERC SPHINX Team to model how climate risks ripple through housing markets. Help uncover when homes become stranded assets and fuel systemic impacts. Help shaping climate resilient policies!</em></strong><br><br><strong>Job description</strong><br>This 4-year fully funded PhD position is part of the ERC Consolidator project “Systemic physical climate risk in complex adaptive economies” (SPHINX). The SPHINX-research program is made possible thanks to a 2-million-euro grant from the European Research Council.<br><br>Background:<br><br>Globally, climate change already manifests via physical risks – damages from floods, storms, wildfires, heatwaves, droughts, and sea-level rise. Concerns are rising that these risks may become systemic, when local damages to one element cannot be contained and adversely affect the entire socio-economic system. Usually, physical climate risk assessments overlay hazard probability, exposure and vulnerability. These future damage estimates linearly extrapolate historic data, assuming that markets efficiently capitalize full information about climate risks and adjust gradually, economic actors have perfect future insight, and socio-economic systems will react to and price unprecedented climate-induced hazards as they did in the past. This approach is criticized for underestimating the true costs of climate change (e.g., at just 1-3% of GDP loss even under severe scenarios), impeding climate action. In contrast, analysis of systemic risks embraces complex interactions among elements/agents, adjusting expectations, mechanisms of contagion dynamics, feedbacks, and non-linear tipping. The SPHINX research program aims to fundamentally advance simulation methods and consolidate novel data to understand how systemic physical climate risks emerge in the socio-economic system, and to explore strategies to curtail their spiraling costs. The project focuses on Europe, with a detailed analysis of three selected case-study regions. Methodologically, SPHINX embraces five pillars, ranging from data collection to agent-based and computable general equilibrium modeling, led by five team members. The first three pillars concern the development of computational agent-based models to explore three different channels of risk propagation with a focus on the triggers of systemic risks. The current PhD position aims to advance assessments of physical climate risks for governments, including the emergence of moral hazard and inequality in the allocation of climate adaptation funding, as well as collateral damage to their budgets.<br><br>Job description:<br><br>The successful candidate will work within the SPHINX research team to explore how governments balance economic development objectives with adaptation to accelerating physical climate risks, as households-voters decide where to live given their preferences for public adaptation. To explore the emergence of moral hazard and fiscal strain for governments under shifting climate risks, the candidate will develop an agent-based model grounded in the Tiebout theory and supported by data, including data on public preferences for allocating adaptation funds. During this 4-year-long project, the PhD student will build on the latest progress in economic research on changes in governmental debt and collateral fiscal damages, and instances of moral hazard and loss of creditworthiness for governments facing escalating climate risks. Connecting the mutually dependent decisions of governments to provide and fund public adaptation, and the location choices of diverse private actors in an agent-based model will be essential here. This modeling effort will benefit from the behavioral data on expectations elicited via tailored household and firm surveys (carried out by another team member) and other spatial and physical climate risk data. The goal of this agent-based modeling is to identify conditions under which risk contagion causes regional decline, and the roots of changing inequality based on how local governments decide on the level of public adaptation provision contingent on both households’ preferences for it and the availability of sufficient tax-based governmental budgets to afford it.<br><br><strong>Job requirements</strong><br>A candidate should ideally have:<br><ul> <li>MSc in Environmental Economics, Spatial Economics, Computational Science, Geography, Environmental Studies, or Engineering &amp; Policy Analysis;</li> <li>Knowledge of a programming language (Python, Julia, etc) and training in any of the simulation methods;</li> <li>Experience with (statistical) data analysis;</li> <li>Previous experience with agent-based modeling or any type of spatial modeling is beneficial;</li> <li>Ability to work with spatial data/GIS is an asset;</li> <li>Domain knowledge in the field of coupled social-environmental systems, climate change or global environmental change in general is an advantage;</li> <li>Solid problem-solving skills and capacity to take the initiative;</li> <li>fluent written and spoken English.

      "description_en": "Heb jij een master in de sociale wetenschappen afgerond? En wil jij bijdragen aan de organisatie van zorgzame buurten zodat de zorg toekomstbestendig wordt? En zou je graag willen promoveren op een plek waar actuele zorgvraagstukken, wetenschappelijk onderzoek en een internationaal kennisnetwerk samenkomen? Bij de vakgroep Healthcare Governance (HCG) van Erasmus School of Health Policy & Management (ESHPM) zijn wij op zoek naar een gemotiveerde en enthousiaste promovendus die etnografisch actieonderzoek wil doen naar samenwerking tussen verschillende publieke organisaties, tech bedrijven, mantelzorgers en ouderen met als gemeenschappelijke uitdaging: hoe maken we samenredzame buurten van de toekomst met behulp van nieuwe zorgrelaties tussen professionals, ouderen en familie, met oog voor waarden en met passende inzet van technologie?\nProjectbeschrijving\nDe Nederlandse gezondheidszorg staat voor grote uitdagingen door de snel vergrijzende bevolking. Deze demografische verschuiving zorgt voor een toenemende zorgvraag en druk op professionele zorgverlening. Om de druk op deze formele zorg te verlichten, pleit de Nederlandse overheid voor een maatschappelijke transitie van ‘ouderenzorg’ naar ‘zorg voor ouderen’. Hierin worden ouderen gestimuleerd om zo lang mogelijk thuis te wonen en zorg in hun eigen omgeving te ontvangen, ondersteund door een actievere rol voor mantelzorgers. Hoewel de noodzaak van deze transitie door veel partijen wordt erkend, brengt deze ook grote uitdagingen met zich mee. Veel mantelzorgers staan namelijk nu al voor enorme lasten, vaak in combinatie met werk en andere verplichtingen.\nIn hun zoektocht naar oplossingen brengen politici, beleidsmakers en zorgorganisaties twee verschillende richtingen naar voren. De eerste richting is het versterken van\nsamenredzaamheid\n. Het centrale idee achter samenredzaamheid is het faciliteren van thuis wonen door middel van nieuwe (informele) zorgnetwerken, waarin zorgverlening als een collectieve inspanning wordt gezien, die is gebaseerd op ondersteuning binnen gemeenschappen. De tweede richting is\ntechnologische innovatie\nals middel om zelfredzaamheid te bevorderen. Technologie en digitalisering worden gezien als cruciale instrumenten om de ouderenzorg duurzaam te houden, taken te automatiseren die traditioneel door formele zorgverleners worden uitgevoerd en ziekenhuisbezoeken te verminderen.\nHoewel samenredzaamheid en technologische innovatie beide gericht zijn op het aanpakken van dezelfde crisis, worden ze grotendeels los van elkaar nagestreefd. In de ontwikkeling van technologie is daardoor vaak weinig oog voor de rol van (informele) zorggemeenschappen, terwijl beleids- en buurtinitiatieven op het terrein van samenredzaamheid vaak weinig aandacht hebben voor mogelijke manieren waarop technologie dit soort initiatieven zou kunnen ondersteunen. Een belangrijke reden hiervoor is dat deze twee oplossingsrichtingen lijken te vertrekken vanuit verschillende onderliggende\nwaarden\n. Zo richt veel technologie zich op efficiëntie en optimalisatie van processen, terwijl initiatieven op het terrein van samenredzaamheid juist relationele verbondenheid hoog in het vaandel hebben staan. Het gevolg is dat veel technologische innovaties op weerstand stuiten, beperkte acceptatie en moeizame inbedding in informele praktijken van zorgverlening, terwijl initiatieven gericht op samenredzaamheid technologische oplossingen niet benutten. Kortom: technologische innovaties passen vaak niet vanzelf in de sociale praktijken van informele netwerken terwijl omgekeerd deze initiatieven de meerwaarde van technologie niet zondermeer zien of omarmen.\nWat ga je doen?\nAls promovendus voer je etnografisch actieonderzoek uit naar een complex en actueel publiek vraagstuk dat in heel Nederland speelt: hoe kunnen verschillende organisaties samenwerken aan een duurzame organisatie van samenredzame buurten waarbij de inzet van technologie goed aansluit bij waarden van ouderen die langer thuis wonen? Partijen die aan je onderzoek meewerken zijn o.a. ouderenorganisaties, verzekeraars, mantelzorgorganisaties, welzijnsinstanties en gemeenten. Zij geven ieder een eigen invulling aan samenredzaamheid en de inzet van technologie thuis. En zij hebben vaak verschillende waarden en belangen die soms botsen in de samenwerking. Deze waardencomplexiteit is het centrale uitgangspunt van het onderzoek en ligt ten grondslag aan de centrale onderzoeksvraag: welke verschillende waarden prioriteren actoren in de samenwerking rondom samenredzame buurten & de inzet van technologie (zoals thuismonitoring maar ook burenapps voor onderling contact)?\nJe brengt niet alleen in kaart welke waardencomplexiteit en conflicten er onderling spelen, maar je doet ook zelf actieonderzoek. Je koppelt relevante inzichten terug aan organisaties, je geeft advies en organiseert workshops. Je onderzoek vertaalt zich zo naar directe maatschappelijke impact. Je draagt bij aan vragen als: hoe kunnen we het beste omgaan met waardenconflicten in de samenwerking? Welke organisatorische randvoorwaarden zijn nodig voor zorgzame buurten van de toekomst? Wat vraagt dit van het zorgsysteem? Je onderzoek heeft daarmee een etnografisch, actiegerichte focus, waarbij samen leren en experimenteren met verschillende organisaties centraal staat.\nJe werkt mee aan het door NWO gefinancierde project\nCARE VISiON (Collaborative Approaches to Reimagining Elder Care: Values-driven Innovations in Samenredzaamheid for Older adults in the Netherlands)\nen maakt deel uit van een geïntegreerd team bestaande uit vier promovendi en twee postdocs. Je empirisch onderzoek levert kritische input voor de ontwikkeling van een interdisciplinair conceptueel kader en een transdisciplinaire visie en tools voor productieve waardenafstemming.\nJe gaat werken in de sectie Healthcare Governance van de Erasmus School of Health Policy & Management (ESHPM), een actieve groep van (PhD-)onderzoekers die vanuit verschillende disciplines empirisch onderzoek uitvoeren naar sturings- en beleidsvraagstukken in de zorg.

      "description_zh": "您已完成社会科学硕士学位吗？您是否想为关爱社区的组织做出贡献，以使医疗保健面向未来？您想在当前的医疗保健问题、科学研究和国际知识网络汇聚的地方获得博士学位吗？在伊拉斯谟健康政策与管理学院 (ESHPM) 的医疗保健治理 (HCG) 系，我们正在寻找一位积极主动、充满热情的博士候选人，他希望对各种公共组织、科技公司、非正式护理人员和老年人之间的合作进行民族志行动研究，并面临共同的挑战：我们如何利用专业人士、老年人和家庭之间的新护理关系，关注价值观并适当使用技术，创建未来的协作社区？\n项目描述\n由于人口迅速老龄化，荷兰医疗保健系统面临重大挑战。这种人口结构的变化造成了对护理的需求不断增加，并给专业护理提供带来了压力。为了缓解这种正规照护的压力，荷兰政府倡导社会从“养老”向“关爱老人”过渡。这鼓励老年人尽可能长时间地住在家里，并在自己的环境中接受护理，并让非正式护理人员发挥更积极的作用。尽管这一转变的必要性得到多方认可，但也带来了重大挑战。许多非正式护理人员已经面临巨大的负担，通常还伴有工作和其他义务。\n在寻找解决方案时，政治家、政策制定者和医疗保健组织提出了两个不同的方向。第一个方向是加强\n相互依赖\n。共同依赖背后的中心思想是通过新的（非正式）护理网络促进家庭生活，其中护理提供被视为基于社区内支持的集体努力。第二个方向是\n技术创新\n作为促进自力更生的手段。技术和数字化被视为保持老年人护理可持续、自动化传统上由正式护理人员执行的任务以及减少医院就诊的重要工具。\n尽管相互依赖和技术创新都旨在解决同一危机，但它们在很大程度上是分开追求的。因此，技术的发展往往很少关注（非正式）护理社区的作用，而相互依赖领域的政策和社区举措往往很少关注技术支持此类举措的可能方式。造成这种情况的一个重要原因是，这两种解决方案似乎是从不同的底层原理出发的\n价值观\n。例如，许多技术注重流程的效率和优化，而相互依赖领域的举措则非常重视关系连接。结果是，许多技术创新在嵌入非正式护理提供实践方面遇到阻力、接受度有限和困难，而旨在相互依赖的举措并未利用技术解决方案。简而言之：技术创新往往不会自动融入非正式网络的社会实践，相反，这些举措也不会自动看到或接受技术的附加值。\n你会怎样做？\n作为一名博士候选人，您对荷兰各地发生的一个复杂且当前的公共问题进行人种学行动研究：不同的组织如何共同努力建立一个可持续的合作社区组织，使技术的使用与在家居住时间较长的老年人的价值观相契合？参与您的研究的各方包括老年人组织、保险公司、非正式护理组织、福利当局和市政当局。他们每个人对相互依赖和国内技术的使用都有自己的解释。而且他们往往有不同的价值观和利益，有时在合作中会发生冲突。这种价值复杂性是研究的核心起点，也是中心研究问题的基础：参与者在围绕协作社区和技术使用（例如家庭监控以及用于相互联系的邻居应用程序）的协作中优先考虑哪些不同的价值观？\n您不仅要弄清楚正在发挥作用的价值复杂性和冲突，而且还要自己进行行动研究。您向组织提供相关见解、提供建议并组织研讨会。因此，您的研究会转化为直接的社会影响。您提出了以下问题：我们如何才能最好地处理合作中的价值冲突？关爱未来社区需要哪些组织先决条件？这对医疗保健系统有何要求？因此，您的研究具有人种学、以行动为导向的重点，其中与不同组织一起学习和实验是核心。\n您参与 NWO 资助的项目\nCARE VISION（重新构想老年人护理的协作方法：荷兰老年人合作中价值驱动的创新）\n是由四名博士生和两名博士后组成的综合团队的一部分。您的实证研究为跨学科概念框架和跨学科愿景以及生产价值协调工具的发展提供了关键的投入。\n您将在伊拉斯谟健康政策与管理学院 (ESHPM) 的医疗保健治理部门工作，该部门是一个活跃的（博士）研究人员小组，他们对医疗保健的管理和政策问题进行不同学科的实证研究。此外，还与伊拉斯谟社会与行为科学学院密切合作，特别是伊拉斯谟社会设计中心，在以设计为导向的社会问题社会科学研究领域拥有丰富的专业知识。\n指导\n指导团队由 Lieke Oldenhof 博士（医疗保健治理，ESHPM）、Rik Wehrens 博士（医疗保健治理，ESHPM）和 Arwin van Buuren 教授（ESSB）组成。",

        "description": "<em>Heb jij een master in de sociale wetenschappen afgerond? En wil jij bijdragen aan de organisatie van zorgzame buurten zodat de zorg toekomstbestendig wordt? En zou je graag willen promoveren op een plek waar actuele zorgvraagstukken, wetenschappelijk onderzoek en een internationaal kennisnetwerk samenkomen? Bij de vakgroep Healthcare Governance (HCG) van Erasmus School of Health Policy &amp; Management (ESHPM) zijn wij op zoek naar een gemotiveerde en enthousiaste promovendus die etnografisch actieonderzoek wil doen naar samenwerking tussen verschillende publieke organisaties, tech bedrijven, mantelzorgers en ouderen met als gemeenschappelijke uitdaging: hoe maken we samenredzame buurten van de toekomst met behulp van nieuwe zorgrelaties tussen professionals, ouderen en familie, met oog voor waarden en met passende inzet van technologie?</em><br><br><strong>Projectbeschrijving</strong><br>De Nederlandse gezondheidszorg staat voor grote uitdagingen door de snel vergrijzende bevolking. Deze demografische verschuiving zorgt voor een toenemende zorgvraag en druk op professionele zorgverlening. Om de druk op deze formele zorg te verlichten, pleit de Nederlandse overheid voor een maatschappelijke transitie van ‘ouderenzorg’ naar ‘zorg voor ouderen’. Hierin worden ouderen gestimuleerd om zo lang mogelijk thuis te wonen en zorg in hun eigen omgeving te ontvangen, ondersteund door een actievere rol voor mantelzorgers. Hoewel de noodzaak van deze transitie door veel partijen wordt erkend, brengt deze ook grote uitdagingen met zich mee. Veel mantelzorgers staan namelijk nu al voor enorme lasten, vaak in combinatie met werk en andere verplichtingen.<br><br>In hun zoektocht naar oplossingen brengen politici, beleidsmakers en zorgorganisaties twee verschillende richtingen naar voren. De eerste richting is het versterken van <em>samenredzaamheid</em>. Het centrale idee achter samenredzaamheid is het faciliteren van thuis wonen door middel van nieuwe (informele) zorgnetwerken, waarin zorgverlening als een collectieve inspanning wordt gezien, die is gebaseerd op ondersteuning binnen gemeenschappen. De tweede richting is <em>technologische innovatie</em> als middel om zelfredzaamheid te bevorderen. Technologie en digitalisering worden gezien als cruciale instrumenten om de ouderenzorg duurzaam te houden, taken te automatiseren die traditioneel door formele zorgverleners worden uitgevoerd en ziekenhuisbezoeken te verminderen.<br><br>Hoewel samenredzaamheid en technologische innovatie beide gericht zijn op het aanpakken van dezelfde crisis, worden ze grotendeels los van elkaar nagestreefd. In de ontwikkeling van technologie is daardoor vaak weinig oog voor de rol van (informele) zorggemeenschappen, terwijl beleids- en buurtinitiatieven op het terrein van samenredzaamheid vaak weinig aandacht hebben voor mogelijke manieren waarop technologie dit soort initiatieven zou kunnen ondersteunen. Een belangrijke reden hiervoor is dat deze twee oplossingsrichtingen lijken te vertrekken vanuit verschillende onderliggende <em>waarden</em>. Zo richt veel technologie zich op efficiëntie en optimalisatie van processen, terwijl initiatieven op het terrein van samenredzaamheid juist relationele verbondenheid hoog in het vaandel hebben staan. Het gevolg is dat veel technologische innovaties op weerstand stuiten, beperkte acceptatie en moeizame inbedding in informele praktijken van zorgverlening, terwijl initiatieven gericht op samenredzaamheid technologische oplossingen niet benutten. Kortom: technologische innovaties passen vaak niet vanzelf in de sociale praktijken van informele netwerken terwijl omgekeerd deze initiatieven de meerwaarde van technologie niet zondermeer zien of omarmen.<br><br><strong>Wat ga je doen?</strong><br>Als promovendus voer je etnografisch actieonderzoek uit naar een complex en actueel publiek vraagstuk dat in heel Nederland speelt: hoe kunnen verschillende organisaties samenwerken aan een duurzame organisatie van samenredzame buurten waarbij de inzet van technologie goed aansluit bij waarden van ouderen die langer thuis wonen? Partijen die aan je onderzoek meewerken zijn o.a. ouderenorganisaties, verzekeraars, mantelzorgorganisaties, welzijnsinstanties en gemeenten. Zij geven ieder een eigen invulling aan samenredzaamheid en de inzet van technologie thuis. En zij hebben vaak verschillende waarden en belangen die soms botsen in de samenwerking. Deze waardencomplexiteit is het centrale uitgangspunt van het onderzoek en ligt ten grondslag aan de centrale onderzoeksvraag: welke verschillende waarden prioriteren actoren in de samenwerking rondom samenredzame buurten &amp; de inzet van technologie (zoals thuismonitoring maar ook burenapps voor onderling contact)?<br><br>Je brengt niet alleen in kaart welke waardencomplexiteit en conflicten er onderling spelen, maar je doet ook zelf actieonderzoek. Je koppelt relevante inzichten terug aan organisaties, je geeft advies en organiseert workshops. Je onderzoek vertaalt zich zo naar directe maatschappelijke impact. Je draagt bij aan vragen als: hoe kunnen we het beste omgaan met waardenconflicten in de samenwerking? Welke organisatorische randvoorwaarden zijn nodig voor zorgzame buurten van de toekomst? Wat vraagt dit van het zorgsysteem? Je onderzoek heeft daarmee een etnografisch, actiegerichte focus, waarbij samen leren en experimenteren met verschillende organisaties centraal staat.<br><br>Je werkt mee aan het door NWO gefinancierde project <em>CARE VISiON (Collaborative Approaches to Reimagining Elder Care: Values-driven Innovations in Samenredzaamheid for Older adults in the Netherlands)</em> en maakt deel uit van een geïntegreerd team bestaande uit vier promovendi en twee postdocs. Je empirisch onderzoek levert kritische input voor de ontwikkeling van een interdisciplinair conceptueel kader en een transdisciplinaire visie en tools voor productieve waardenafstemming.<br><br>Je gaat werken in de sectie Healthcare Governance van de Erasmus School of Health Policy &amp; Management (ESHPM), een actieve groep van (PhD-)onderzoekers die vanuit verschillende disciplines empirisch onderzoek uitvoeren naar sturings- en beleidsvraagstukken in de zorg.

Within the IES program, research is conducted into operation and planning of future sustainable energy systems, with an emphasis on electricity systems, markets and systems integration. This research is performed in two research labs: the Digital power and energy systems lab (EES DigiPES lab) and the Electricity markets and power system optimization lab (EES EMPDO lab). The former focuses on intelligent energy network research, including: demand management and flexibility, digital twinning, data analytics, smart grid ICT architectures and systems integration in multi energy systems. The latter specializes in electricity market design (centralized & decentralized), market products & system services to integrate new technologies, forecasting, market participation strategies and risk management, large-scale, distributed, multi-objective optimization techniques applied to energy markets and power systems and AI for optimization and control in power and energy systems. The EES group has strong ties with industry both nationally and internationally, with several part-time industry researchers working in the group and a large group of strategic collaboration partners.\nRecently, the Electrical Energy Systems group received grants for nationally-funded projects in Intelligent Electricity Systems. Therefore, this group currently has multiple vacancies in this field.\nWe are currently looking for researchers with strong energy systems knowledge, electricity, heat, and gas netwrok modelling & simulation, and research software development skills\nthat want to develop cutting-edge knowledge and software for the\nenergy transition. The focus of the work will be on the application of intelligent software approaches (distributed control systems, distributed optimization, market mechanisms, multi-scale modelling, etc.), in electrical power systems (energy system flexibility coordination, local energy markets, capacity & congestion management, etc.).\nInformation\nThe transition to sustainable urban energy systems is a cornerstone of climate-neutral cities. Positive Energy Districts (PEDs) are emerging as a key concept in this transition, aiming to produce more energy than they consume on an annual basis. However, the operation of PEDs is increasingly complex due to the integration of multiple energy vectors (electricity, heating, gas, water, etc.), the variability of renewable energy sources, and the need for real-time coordination among distributed assets.\nResilience —the ability of a system to anticipate, absorb, adapt to, and rapidly recover from disruptions— is a critical yet underexplored dimension in PED operations. This research is a part of an NWO project called “Enabling Positive Energy Districs through citizen-centered socio-technical models for upscaling pf the heat transition” or EmPowerED that studies various aspects of the PEDs to deliver a theoretically informed and empirically validated scalable integrated systems co-creation approach for carbon-neutral heating that can be tailored to the specific local PED context. This PhD is part of the technical study and modelling of the project that needs to focus on a resilience-oriented operational framework for multi-commodity PEDs, addressing both steady-state optimization and dynamic response to disturbances. EmPowerED is a large project with around 38 partners including different universities, research institutes, municipalities, energy communities, distribution system operators, and technology providers. The student will have the opportunity to be a part of this project and participate in project meetings, contribute to the discussion with the end-users, energy communities, and municipalities. There would be close collaboration between the PhD students in this project and the technology providers as the outcomes of the PhD studies could be incorporated into their commercial solutions.\nCurrent PED operational strategies often prioritize energy efficiency and carbon neutrality but lack mechanisms to ensure resilience against disruptions such as grid outages, extreme weather events, or cyber-physical attacks. Moreover, the multi-commodity nature of PEDs introduces interdependencies that can amplify vulnerabilities. Although the congestion management is and remains one of the main concerns for the stakeholders involved in PEDs, there are further research questions that come to mind when the multi-energy aspect of PEDs is considered:\n- How can resilience be quantitatively assessed in the context of multi-commodity PEDs?\n- What operational strategies can enhance the resilience of PEDs without compromising energy positivity?\n- How do interdependencies among energy vectors affect the propagation of disruptions?\n- What are the trade-offs between resilience, efficiency, and sustainability in PED operations?\nConsidering the above-mentioned research questions and regarding the framework of the EmPowerED project, the objective of this PhD study is defined as follows:\n- Develop a comprehensive resilience assessment framework tailored to multi-commodity PEDs, considering electricity, heating, and water drainage networks.\n- Design a multi-layered operational strategy that integrates resilience metrics into energy management systems on a district level.\n- Model and simulate the dynamic behavior of PEDs under various disruption scenarios, with a focus on electricity and heat networks.\n- Validate the proposed approach through case studies and use cases of the project.\nThese goals are achieved through the implementation of a comprehensive analysis of the existing resilience metrics and operational strategies of PEDs. Various scenarios need to be created and studied for each commodity (i.e., electricity, heat, water drainage) and their interdependencies’ impact on energy management within a district while maintaining energy positivity. The use of new technologies in district heating systems (e.g., low-temperature heating) and their impact should be included in these scenarios.\nConceptual framework development requires establishing resilience indicators for PEDs as well as defining its dimensions considering the interdependence among various networks. The scenarios and the developed concept need to be modelled and simulated for each energy carrier flow, following an optimization problem incorporating resilience techniques. A digital twin of PED needs to be developed integrating real data (where available) and the analysed scenarios. AI models for predictive resilience assessment should be developed and tested. The results of this simulation and modelling can be integrated within the commercial interfaces of the project for the end users involved in the project.\nThe position is supervised by dr.ir. N.

      "description_en": "Do you want to be part of an industry-oriented project and work on flexibility estimation from industrial sites?\nThe envisioned research is part of the research program Intelligent Energy Systems (IES) performed within the Electrical Energy Systems (EES) group of TU/e. Within the IES program, research is conducted into operation and planning of future sustainable energy systems, with an emphasis on electricity systems, markets and systems integration. This research is performed in two research labs: the Digital power and energy systems lab (EES DigiPES lab) and the Electricity markets and power system optimization lab (EES EMPDO lab). The former focuses on intelligent energy network research, including: demand management and flexibility, digital twinning, data analytics, smart grid ICT architectures and systems integration in multi energy systems. The latter specializes in electricity market design (centralized & decentralized), market products & system services to integrate new technologies, forecasting, market participation strategies and risk management, large-scale, distributed, multi-objective optimization techniques applied to energy markets and power systems and AI for optimization and control in power and energy systems. The EES group has strong ties with industry both nationally and internationally, with several part-time industry researchers working in the group and a large group of strategic collaboration partners.\nRecently, the Electrical Energy Systems group received grants for nationally-funded projects in Intelligent Electricity Systems. Therefore, this group currently has multiple vacancies in this field.\nWe are currently looking for researchers with strong energy systems knowledge, electricity, heat, and gas system components and flexibility modelling & simulation, and research software development skills\nthat want to develop cutting-edge knowledge and software for the\nenergy transition. The focus of the work will be on the application of intelligent software approaches (distributed control systems, distributed optimization, market mechanisms, multi-scale modelling, etc.), in electrical power systems (energy system flexibility coordination, local energy markets, capacity & congestion management, etc.).\nInformation\nThe decarbonization of the industrial sector is critical to achieving climate neutrality. Steam-based industries, such as chemical manufacturing, food processing, and paper production, are among the most energy-intensive and carbon-emitting sectors. Electrification of thermal processes, particularly through the integration of industrial heat pumps, presents a promising pathway to reduce emissions while offering flexibility services to the energy system.\nAt the same time, the increasing penetration of variable renewable energy such as wind and solar creates a pressing need for\nflexibility services\nto balance supply and demand. Industrial processes, with their significant thermal inertia and storage potential, can provide valuable flexibility to the power grid. However, the integration of such services into\nsteam-heated industrial processes\nremains a challenge, especially when considering the role of\nlarge-scale heat pumps,\nindustrial heat storage, and heat recovery technologies\nas both decarbonization and flexibility enablers. The challenge rises from several factors affecting the daily operation of the factories as well as the investment requirements that might not be compensated accordingly when the derived flexibility is offered to the grid/market. In this regard, this PhD focuses on optimizing the use of flexibility in electrified process plants by leveraging dynamic behaviors and market participation.\nWith the above premises, the main objectives of this study are\n- Characterize the thermal demand profiles of steam-based industrial processes and identify opportunities for electrification. => Baseline optimisation\nBaseline optimisation\n- Assess the technical feasibility and performance of industrial heat pumps in steam generation and recovery. => Design options and technology inclusions\nDesign options and technology inclusions\n- Develop models to quantify the flexibility potential of electrified steam systems, including load shifting, demand response, and ancillary services. => Energy use optimisation\nEnergy use optimisation\n- Assess the techno-economic feasibility of providing flexibility services from electrified steam processes. => Business assessment\nBusiness assessment\n- Grid impact assessment and capacity management approaches in an industry-infused network with integrated industrial flexibility services. => Grid impact assessment\nGrid impact assessment\nIn order to achieve these goals, the following tasks would shape the work plan of the PhD:\nEnergy Portfolio Creation:\nA comprehensive estimation of the available flexibility within electrified process plants should be undertaken. This task involves a detailed assessment of the various processes and identifying potential extractable flexibility from electrified thermal systems. The goal is to quantify the extent to which these processes can be adjusted or modulated, taking into account the operational constraints and requirements. This estimation will include analyzing the energy consumption patterns, identifying peak and off-peak periods, and understanding the critical operational parameters that must remain stable. The maximum achievable flexibility that can be harnessed without compromising the efficiency, productivity, and overall operational stability of the process plants can be determined. This rigorous analysis will provide a clear picture of the flexibility potential and set the stage for implementing effective flexibility services tailored to the dynamic behavior of the process industry.\nFlexibility service definition and potential calculations:\nThe next task would be to identify and define flexibility services that are specifically tailored to the dynamic nature of process industries. This involves a thorough examination of the various industrial processes to determine how they can be adapted or modulated to provide flexibility services. The approach includes a detailed analysis of the operational characteristics and requirements of each process, aiming to understand the inherent dynamic behaviors and how they can be leveraged to create flexibility.\nThrough exploring different strategies for modulating processes, such as adjusting production schedules, varying energy consumption rates, and implementing advanced control systems, new definitions for flexibility services from industry will be provided. This definition would consider the type, feature, and characteristics of the service from both industry side and market side, meaning the conditions that the plant needs to follow to provide such services as well as the market conditions to which the service is offered.\nEvaluating implementation potential:\nIn this task,\nthe energy market status for the process industry will be analysed to determine the viability of electrified processes considering the increased required electric demand and the new possibilities of saving energy costs using the flexibility of electrified thermal systems. To achieve this, the current status of the markets will be analysed to assess the possibility of incorporating industrial flexibility. Different revenue schemes will be considered to deploy industrial flexibility as a product in the market. The flexibility trade with the characteristics of flexibility from industrial processes will be analysed. The energy market status for both electricity and gas markets will be studied to evaluate the viability of electrification for specific cases and in regard to price growth of electricity and gas. The trade portfolio of an electrified industrial site will be provided with possibilities of energy market participation, flexibility services remuneration, and CO2 to capture revenues.\nThis PhD is part of a NWO project called “Flexibility in Electric Power from Steam-heated Industrial Processes” (FLEXPower). There are several partners involved in this project including a large distribution system operator, industrial partners, industrial flexibility technology providers, and an applied research institute. The PhD student will be involved in this project, will have the chance to participate in meetings, and have a close collaboration with industry.

Yet, their emergence and timing remain difficult to anticipate and manage. This PhD will develop a machine learning module to detect early warning signals of positive tipping points from techno-economic data, helping policymakers design adaptive strategies for rapid and resilient decarbonization.\nYour research will combine time-series analysis, supervised and unsupervised learning, and explainable AI methods to uncover the dynamic patterns preceding technological breakthroughs or large-scale adoption events. The module will be validated on both historical datasets and scenario data generated by Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), large climate-economic models used for mapping future decarbonization pathways. Building on these insights, you will explore policy portfolios that are responsive to emerging tipping dynamics, assessing their trade-offs. Your key tasks will include:\n- Applying and comparing machine learning methods for time-series analysis and tipping point detection.\n- Developing an interpretable machine learning framework to detect early warning signals of energy transition tipping points.\n- Validating the new module with historical and scenario datasets.\n- Designing adaptive policy portfolios responsive to tipping dynamics within a stylized IAM.\n- Assessing trade-offs in transition outcomes, including economic feasibility, equity, and robustness.\nYour work environment\nYou will carry out this research as part of the ERC-funded RIPPLE project, led by Professor Giacomo Marangoni, and embedded within the Policy Analysis section of the Multi-Actor Systems department.

Shortages, trade frictions, and financial mismatches can stall otherwise viable tipping dynamics and establish carbon-intensive lock-ins.\nThis PhD will develop an agent-based inspired module that maps global flows of key materials (e.g., lithium, copper, nickel, tin), climate-finance streams, and trade relationships to derive feasibility and lock-in indicators of alternative transitions to clean energy technologies. Coupled to an existing family of climate-energy-economic models, called Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), the module will quantify how resource scarcity, investment risk, and coordination failures reshape decarbonization pathways. Your research will combine methods from network analysis and agent-based modelling of economic systems to trace how international material and financial interdependencies support or limit the feasibility of a clean energy transition. Your key tasks will include:\n- Designing and implementing an agent-based inspired model of global material and financial networks;\n- Deriving and analyzing quantitative indicators of feasibility, scarcity, and lock-in risk associated with trade and investment flows bottlenecks;\n- Coupling the module to existing climate-energy-economic models to assess alternative transition pathways under varying geopolitical and financial scenarios;\n- Evaluating trade-offs across feasibility, equity, and robustness dimensions of the energy transition.\nYour work environment\nYou will carry out this research as part of the ERC-funded RIPPLE project, led by Professor Giacomo Marangoni, and embedded within the Policy Analysis section of the Multi-Actor Systems department.

Join TU Delft and develop AI-driven solutions for sustainable, efficient, and collaborative port operations of the future.\nJob description\nEuropean seaports must achieve net zero emission by 2050 and 55% emission reduction (‘fit for 55’) by 2030 as agreed in the European Green Deal and comply with the FuelEU Maritime and EU Emissions Trading System regulations, presenting unprecedented challenges. Up to 80% of the emissions in ports are attributed to the port call process of ships visiting the port. Efforts of a single actor to reduce emissions will be suboptimal, or may even be counterproductive, for the port call process as a whole. In addition, the anticipated sharp surge in demand for electricity and renewable fuels introduces new uncertainties. Would you like to address this urgent need and develop new methods to support coordinated decision-making for sustainable strategies in the port call? As a PhD student at TU Delft, you will leverage AI (i.e. optimization and machine learning techniques) to prepare ports, terminals, shipping companies, and other port actors for this important challenge.\nYour research will be part of the PortCall.Zero project - a five-year project with multiple industry partners such as Port of Rotterdam and APMT/Maersk and overall eight researchers who will work together with you on different aspects towards decarbonized and efficient port calls. In the PortCall.Zero project, you will develop novel AI methods and tools that capture the complexity of the port call process and handle uncertainties caused by the energy transitions. In collaboration with the other researchers, this will include the economic viability of operations and governance aspects. The approach will be demonstrated in the port of Rotterdam and other European ports, putting the project in the leading position globally with the most sustainable and efficient port call processes. The research of the project will be conducted jointly with our industry partners to develop new products and services for ports globally, giving you the opportunity to get involved in cutting-edge research and gain industry experience in close collaboration with our partners.\nApart from the PortCall.Zero community, you will be joining an interdisciplinary and active team of PhD students and professors at the Maritime & Transport Technology department and Transport Engineering & Logistics section. If you are interested, you will also have the opportunity to support related lectures and coach our master students during their graduation research. Next to the PhD commmunity, your fellow team members are assistant and associate professors, lecturers, project managers, and postdocs with different nationalities. We share a drive to enable maritime operations of the future, harnessing our combined expertise to develop models and tools.

Join TU Delft and develop AI-driven solutions for sustainable, efficient, and collaborative port operations of the future. <br> <br></em></strong><br><br><strong>Job description</strong><br>European seaports must achieve net zero emission by 2050 and 55% emission reduction (‘fit for 55’) by 2030 as agreed in the European Green Deal and comply with the FuelEU Maritime and EU Emissions Trading System regulations, presenting unprecedented challenges. Up to 80% of the emissions in ports are attributed to the port call process of ships visiting the port. Efforts of a single actor to reduce emissions will be suboptimal, or may even be counterproductive, for the port call process as a whole. In addition, the anticipated sharp surge in demand for electricity and renewable fuels introduces new uncertainties. Would you like to address this urgent need and develop new methods to support coordinated decision-making for sustainable strategies in the port call? As a PhD student at TU Delft, you will leverage AI (i.e. optimization and machine learning techniques) to prepare ports, terminals, shipping companies, and other port actors for this important challenge.<br><br>Your research will be part of the PortCall.Zero project - a five-year project with multiple industry partners such as Port of Rotterdam and APMT/Maersk and overall eight researchers who will work together with you on different aspects towards decarbonized and efficient port calls. In the PortCall.Zero project, you will develop novel AI methods and tools that capture the complexity of the port call process and handle uncertainties caused by the energy transitions. In collaboration with the other researchers, this will include the economic viability of operations and governance aspects. The approach will be demonstrated in the port of Rotterdam and other European ports, putting the project in the leading position globally with the most sustainable and efficient port call processes. The research of the project will be conducted jointly with our industry partners to develop new products and services for ports globally, giving you the opportunity to get involved in cutting-edge research and gain industry experience in close collaboration with our partners.<br><br>Apart from the PortCall.Zero community, you will be joining an interdisciplinary and active team of PhD students and professors at the Maritime &amp; Transport Technology department and Transport Engineering &amp; Logistics section.

      "description_en": "Job description\nThe exponential increase of computational power over the last decade has enabled scale-resolving simulations (SRS) of turbulent flows at an unprecedented resolution. In combination with high-performance computing (HPC), parallel computational fluid dynamic simulations can currently resolve spatial and temporal scales of industrially-relevant turbulent flows within days/weeks. On the other hand, typical design cycles in industry still make extensive use of low-fidelity simulations which can provide fast but inaccurate solutions depending on the flow complexity.\nTo close this gap, this PhD will explore machine-learning (ML) methods to significantly reduce the turnaround time of SRS, thus enabling their use for industrial design processes. By combining state-of-the-art numerical methods and data-driven modelling techniques, the PhD candidate will investigate novel frameworks to accelerate SRS in HPC environments.\nThe PhD candidate will work at the Ship Hydrodynamics section of the Department of Maritime and Transport Technology (Faculty of Mechanical Engineering). This environment facilitates the exchange of research knowledge with colleagues also working in CFD and ML, both in applied and fundamental areas. The candidate will develop transferable skills such as HPC software development, extensive physical understanding of turbulent flows, and experience in modern ML architectures such as neural operators and transformers.\nThe expected start date is February 2026, and the PhD duration contract is 4 years.

In combination with high-performance computing (HPC), parallel computational fluid dynamic simulations can currently resolve spatial and temporal scales of industrially-relevant turbulent flows within days/weeks. On the other hand, typical design cycles in industry still make extensive use of low-fidelity simulations which can provide fast but inaccurate solutions depending on the flow complexity.<br><br>To close this gap, this PhD will explore machine-learning (ML) methods to significantly reduce the turnaround time of SRS, thus enabling their use for industrial design processes. By combining state-of-the-art numerical methods and data-driven modelling techniques, the PhD candidate will investigate novel frameworks to accelerate SRS in HPC environments.<br><br>The PhD candidate will work at the Ship Hydrodynamics section of the Department of Maritime and Transport Technology (Faculty of Mechanical Engineering).

Solar photovoltaics (PV) was identified by the IPCC as the technology with the highest potential among emission mitigation options. Scientific studies modelling energies scenarios for net zero emissions by 2050 project that a solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity of about 60 TWp needs to be installed within the next 25 years. To achieve this goal the global installed PV capacity has already doubled from 1 TW to 2 TW in the past 2 years [4].\nThe current industrial standard photovoltaic (PV) module design with difficulty in recycling has generated worldwide concerns regarding an estimated stream of 212 million tons of end-of-life PV modules. Thus, research into PV modules designed for cricularity is needed.\nResearch questions/aims:\nIn this project, we aim to accelerate the development of novel liquid-filled circular PV modules, which can be repaired and recycled in a modular manner, similar to the Fairphone. The goal of this project is to improve the new PV module design to equivalent or even better performance and durability compared to existing PV modules and, in the process, train a group of young engineers in developing more circular PV modules to spark future innovations .\nIn parallel, we aim to implement the research findings in a PV start-up company such as Biosphere Solar to introduce the technology to consumers as soon as possible.\nList of research goals:\n- Experimental comparistion liquid encapsulated PV modules efficiency and repliability on at least on the level of conventional PV modules.\n- Demonstrating improved circularity (repairability, remanucaturing, recycling) of liquid encapsulated PV modules.\n- Living lab tests of prototypes, providing insights into real life operation conditions to verify energy yield.\nResearch methods:\nAn iterative design and testing cycle of developing improved prototypes and testing them in terms of performance, durability, repairability and recyclability will be used. The in-house lab tests according to IEC61215 standards will be supported by outdoor testing in a living laboratory. The results will be shared globally as part of the Task 12 on PV Sustainability in the International Energy Agencies (IEA) Photovoltaic Power Systems Programme (PVPS) to increase the impact and reach of this project.\nThe program of the PVMD group builds up expertise in the design and fabrication technology from solar cells to PV systems with their power electronics and storage options. You will contribute to the PV & Circularity team in TU Delft’s PVMD group.

What spatial planning approaches best balance food production goals, environmental quality objectives, and community well-being?<br><br>Meso-level modelling (e.g. at the level of river basins or provinces) could find an answer to these questions by bridging global and local perspectives and capturing both fine-scale landscape patterns and the diverse, context-specific human decision-making processes that shape land-use outcomes. Using real-world cases, the selected candidate will investigate and model how economic incentives and behavioural drivers interact to shape land-use decisions and their consequences for biodiversity and ecosystem services. This research will help identify which policies and incentives can foster effective nature restoration, strengthen ecosystem resilience, and support sustainable food systems in a spatially explicit manner.<br><br><strong>Your duties</strong><br><ul> <li>You conduct innovative research on the interactions between economic incentives, behavioural drivers, and land-use decisions at the meso-scale (e.g. river basins or regions), using clear case studies.</li> <li>You develop modelling approaches that bridge economic analysis and spatial explicit landscape level modelling.</li> <li>You analyse the consequences of land-use decisions for biodiversity, ecosystem services, and sustainable food systems.</li> <li>You identify and assess policy instruments and incentives that can foster effective nature restoration and enhance ecosystem resilience.</li> <li>You publish research findings in peer-reviewed journals and present at international scientific conferences and workshops.</li>\n</ul>",

Werk je graag mee met professionals in de sociale en eerstelijnzorg om gokschade te herkennen? Dan zoeken wij jou!\nOver het project\nGokschade, de negatieve gevolgen door het deelnemen aan gokken, heeft verstrekkende gevolgen voor individuen, gezinnen en gemeenschappen. De legalisering van online gokken in Nederland in 2021 heeft geleid tot een toename in deelname, vooral onder kwetsbare groepen. Ondanks de groeiende impact van gokschade ontbreekt in Nederland een structureel systeem voor vroege signalering en gerichte doorverwijzing van mensen die lijden aan gokschade, met name binnen de sociale en eerstelijnszorg. Professionals in deze sectoren beschikken vaak niet over de juiste kennis, middelen of samenwerkingsstructuren om gokproblemen tijdig te herkennen en passende zorg te bieden.\nIn het ZonMw- project ‘Implementatie van een community-based signalering- en doorverwijzing-network voor gokschade’ zullen wij een netwerk van professionals (e.g. gemeente, huisartspraktijken, wijkteam, en preventiemedewerkers) in Rotterdam samenbrengen om gokschade vroegtijdig te herkennen en toegang tot zorg te verbeteren. Met een Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) aanpak werken onderzoekers, professionals en ervaringsdeskundigen (Experts by Experience) samen aan het in kaart brengen van behoeften, risico’s en bestanden netwerken, het co-creëren van laagdrempelige screenings- en verwijstools, en het implementeren en borgen van een duurzaam samenwerkingsmodel.\nHet project levert direct toepasbare inzichten op voor\nbeleid, preventie en zorgpraktijk\n,\nen wetenschappelijke kennis over effectieve, community-gedreven implementatie. Het promotietraject wordt uitgevoerd aan de Erasmus Universiteit Rotterdam, onder begeleiding van dr. Marilisa Boffo en dr.

Hier onderzoek je hoe data en AI kunnen helpen bij slimme, duurzame ruimtelijke keuzes.\nDuaal promotietraject Versterking informatiepositie provincies\n32-36 uur | Den Haag\nDit zijn wij\nDe twaalf provincies van Nederland hebben elk hun eigen karakter, maar delen dezelfde opgave: regionale oplossingen vinden voor grote maatschappelijke thema’s zoals water, wonen, energie, natuur en landbouw. Ook maken de provincies het verschil op de grote transitie van het landelijk gebied. Het Interprovinciaal Overleg (IPO) vertegenwoordigt hun gezamenlijke belangen, stimuleert innovatie en kennisdeling en fungeert als gesprekspartner van het Rijk. Daarnaast organiseert het IPO overleg en samenwerking tussen de twaalf provincies. Kortom,\nhet IPO\nverbindt, vertegenwoordigt én versterkt de provincies.\nHet team\nJe start binnen het team Ruimte van het programma Ruimte & Leefomgeving. In dit team komen de verschillende provinciale opgaven het duidelijkst samen. Afhankelijk van het verloop van jouw promotieonderzoek is het mogelijk dat je voor een deel van de looptijd van het PhD-traject ook bij de andere programma’s wordt ingezet. Voorbeelden van die programma’s zijn Bereikbaarheid & Infrastructuur (BenI) en Klimaat & Energie (KenE). Ook leg je in je werk de brug naar het programma Digitalisering, zodat data en AI concreet landen in beleid en uitvoering.\nDuaal promoveren: werken én onderzoeken\nIn dit traject combineer je wetenschap met praktijk:\n- 3 dagen per week werk je bij het IPO, waar je jouw inzichten direct toepast;\n- 2 dagen per week doe je promotieonderzoek aan de universiteit of hogeschool.\nZo kun je jouw onderzoek voeden met praktijkervaring en draag je tegelijkertijd bij aan innovatie binnen de provinciale bestuurslaag. Een mooie kans om wetenschap, beleid en data-innovatie te verbinden! Je werkt daarbij samen met promotoren van de TU Delft en de Hogeschool van Amsterdam, collega’s binnen het IPO en experts. En mooi meegenomen voor je toekomst: je bouwt een waardevol netwerk op binnen de twaalf provincies én bij het Rijk. Het vraagstuk: de weerbarstigheid van de “ruimtelijke puzzel” Nederland staat voor grote ruimtelijke keuzes op het gebied van zoetwaterbeschikbaarheid, energie, landbouw, economie en wonen. Provincies spelen hierin een sleutelrol, maar beschikken nog niet over een gezamenlijke, datagedreven informatiebasis om deze complexe opgaven goed te verbinden, zowel binnen hun eigen provincie als in samenhang met elkaar. Het IPO onderzoekt hoe data en AI kunnen helpen om provinciale keuzes beter te onderbouwen en ruimtelijke ontwikkelingen in Nederland structureel te versnellen. Dat klinkt als een duidelijke opdracht, maar de werkelijkheid is weerbarstig. Voor een uitgebreide toelichting op dit vraagstuk, zie de bijlage hieronder in dit document: \"Het vraagstuk: de weerbarstigheid van de 'ruimtelijke puzzel'.\" Jouw impact als duaal PhD-kandidaat Als duaal PhD-kandidaat bij het IPO draag jij bij aan het oplossen van knelpunten bij ruimtelijke keuzes in de fysieke leefomgeving, zodat Nederland blijvend vooruit kan.

      "description_en": "Job description\nTACIT Project\nThis position is based within the NWO's Perspectief project, TACIT (Inclusive Technologies for Access and Social Participation). The goal is to co-design AI-enabled adaptive image and schema descriptions for digitized books and collections of the National Library of the Netherlands (KB) for blind and visually impaired readers.\nBackground\nAround 25% of the Dutch population lives with long-term visual, hearing, or cognitive disabilities and diversities, often facing barriers to participation, equity and inclusion. The European Accessibility Act (EAA), which mandates that EU service providers ensure digital accessibility by 2025, marks a critical step toward reducing these inequalities. However, technology that is not co-designed with affected communities often lacks social acceptance and fails to meet real needs. As part of the TACIT (Inclusive Technologies for Access and Social Participation) project, this PhD position will contribute to the co-design and co-creation of AI and immersive media technologies through inclusive Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and participatory design methods. TACIT aims to enhance the accessibility of public services, accelerate the adoption of the EAA, drive innovation in assistive technologies, and promote broader societal inclusion through equitable, inclusive, and human-centered design.

      "description_en": "Challenge: Cost-effective passenger railways\nChange: Integrating planning of rolling stock circulations and rolling stock maintenance\nImpact: Improved railway logistics\nJob description\nPassenger railway transport plays an essential role in sustainable mobility. It is based on dedicated railway infrastructure, rolling stock and personnel that need to be aligned by efficient planning and replanning to optimize the allocation of the resources and maintain reliable operations in face of disturbances and disruptions. Rolling stock (or railway vehicles) also needs regular maintenance at service locations including inspections, cleaning, and repairs. Incidents during operations such as broken toilets or failing doors may also trigger changes to the plans to prioritize maintenance to these specific train units. The interaction between rolling stock circulations and regular maintenance, including the uncertainties involved, leads to complex logistics problems.\nThe planning of rolling stock circulations and the regular maintenance at the various service locations is typically done by different planners. In addition, shunting train units between the station platforms and the service locations further complicates the operations (re)planning and involves yet other planners and (shunting) personnel. While regular rolling stock maintenance used to be executed largely in the evening or at night such that all rolling stock is available during the day, saturating capacity at service locations and attractive working hours for personnel require alternative solutions, such as moving rolling stock maintenance to daytime on days or periods with less transport demand.\nThe objective of this PhD project is to develop and demonstrate a methodology for integrated planning of railway rolling stock circulations, regular maintenance and train unit shunting. The integrated planning offers opportunities such as reduced rolling stock with equal seat availability, more attractive working hours at service locations, and decreased train unit movements for regular maintenance. New innovative approaches need to be developed to schedule rolling stock to timetables and service locations while considering requirements of various personnel and special requests during operations based on specific train unit conditions. This requires multiple-criteria decision-making methods to find effective and efficient integrated planning solutions based on existing tools at Netherlands Railways and newly developed optimization models. Simulation studies will be applied to test and demonstrate the developed concepts and algorithms for integrated (re)planning. This PhD research will use a mixture of techniques from logistics, operations research, multiple-criteria decision making and simulation.\nYou will work in the Digital Rail Traffic Lab (DRTLab) and the Smart Public Transport Lab (SPTL) within the Department of Transport and Planning (T&P) at Delft University of Technology. You will be supervised by Prof. Rob Goverde and Dr. Niels van Oort, in close cooperation with Netherlands Railways. T&P is part of the Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences at TU Delft. In the past 30 years, the department has grown into a world-leading centre for transport science and engineering, providing top-level education and world-class scientific research. The Department is organized in collaborative research labs, including the DRTLab and SPTL. The DRTLab develops innovative concepts, models and methods for resilient railway transport systems. SPTL develops new solutions and methods for public transport planning, operations and management.
