Do you want to explore physics that nobody else has seen? Maybe you want to join our team as a PhD on our exciting journey towards the superradiant and zero-deadtime clocks. We are the\nultracold strontium group\nat the University of Amsterdam and you can read more about the project\nhere\n.\nJoin Us!\nThis PhD position is part of the European doctoral network\nQuRIOUS\n, which has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon Europe research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement number 101227522. You will participate in network meetings across Europe, where you will learn about quantum technology from experts in the field and train essential skills, such as academic writing and outreach. You will participate in a summer school and regular consortium meetings with the other PhDs. You will spend time in the lab of a consortium partner.\nThis is what you will do\nWith this project, you will join\na team of experimental quantum physicists\nat the\nUniversity of Amsterdam\nwho are building two new types of optical clock. Optical clocks are the most precise measurement instruments in the world, going wrong by only one second over the lifetime of the universe. They enable searches for beyond standard model physics, can explore quantum many-body systems, and have practical applications in geodesy, navigation and network synchronization.\nState-of-the-art optical clocks are working in a pulsed fashion and need hours of averaging to reach their final accuracy. A main goal of our research is to reduce this to a few minutes, which would open new opportunities for clocks. We want to achieve this by creating clocks that can be operated truly continuously, using technology that we have developed to achieve continuous Bose-Einstein condensation [\nNature\n606\n, 683 (2022)\n]. We are building two types of such clocks: a superradiant clock and a zero-deadtime clock. A superradiant clock is a laser that lases on an ultranarrow optical transition. You can read about our plans for this clock in\nSheng Zhou’s PhD thesis\n. For the zero-deadtime clock, we supply atoms from a continuous ultracold Sr source to four clock interrogation zones that are in one vacuum chamber. Clock interrogation can always be executed in at least one zone, while others are reloaded with atoms, enabling continuous operation.

Join our ERC-funded project and uncover the physics behind inertial dense suspensions, flows that shape technologies from energy storage to biomedical systems.\nJob description\nInertial Dense Suspensions (IDeS) are common in nature and industry, with examples ranging from blood flow and recycling to waste slurry transport, additive manufacturing, and energy storage solutions. Despite their practical importance, these flows remain poorly understood. As a result, even the most basic properties cannot be predicted reliably. For instance, the best available models over- or underestimate the measured pressure drop in a suspension pipe flow by 30–40% across different flow rates. This makes designing and controlling these flows difficult. The difficulty arises partly because these flows do not fit the conventional ‘laminar’ versus ‘turbulent’ classification; they inhabit a terra incognita. Most theoretical studies so far have focused on confined suspensions in the viscous regime, but this idealized approach is insufficient for practical applications. Finite particle size and velocity introduce complex inertial phenomena, such as particle-induced fluctuations, a gradual transition to turbulence, and shear-induced migration. These effects are at best only qualitatively understood, yet they profoundly alter the flow behavior. Understanding and accurately modelling these flows will enable more energy-efficient transport of industrial slurries, improve our understanding of blood flow, and support the development of sustainable manufacturing processes.\nThese PhD-positions are part of the\nERC Advanced Grant project IDeS\nwhere you will join a team investigating densely-laden pipe flows. Two PhD positions are available within the project:\n- PhD 1 will focus on optical techniques to quantify the near-wall behavior using volumetric flow measurement techniques (e.g. Lagrangian particle tracking or tomo-PIV) and model the fluctuations that are introduced by the particles. The interaction of the fluctuations with the transition to turbulence will also be investigated and captured in a physical model.\ninteraction of the fluctuations with the transition to turbulence\n- PhD 2 will work on ultrasound imaging velocimetry combined with shadowgraphy to quantify the shear-induced migration of particles, and capture this in a model. The role of volume fraction, particle size, Reynolds number and density ratio will be investigated and captured in a model.\nultrasound imaging velocimetry\nWhile the challenging scientific goals of each project are distinct, we expect a close collaboration to work towards the final goal of being able to predict these flows.\nYour work environment\nYou will be part of the\nMultiphase Systems group\nwithin the\nProcess & Energy Department\nat TU Delft. The group studies fundamental and applied aspects of multiphase flows, combining advanced experiments and state-of-the-art numerical simulations. Research focuses on dense dispersions, turbulence interacting with free surfaces, and transitions in particle-laden flows, with applications ranging from slurries and food emulsions to 3D printing and transport of floating structures.\nWithin the group, you will work in a collaborative and international environment, which has access to\nunique experimental facilities\nsuch as MRI, X-ray, and ultrasound imaging, alongside high-performance computing resources. The positions include conducting experimental research, publishing in peer-reviewed journals, presenting at conferences, and mentoring BSc and MSc students. The group values open interaction, knowledge sharing, and teamwork, fostering both individual growth and collective scientific excellence.\nTU Delft (Delft University of Technology)\nDelft University of Technology is built on strong foundations.

How can ceramics embody violence and loss, yet be an anchor of belonging? We seek an ambitious PhD candidate interested in combining social scientific rigor with the affective force of visual storytelling to explore ways of knowing difficult pasts and heritage.\nExploring craft, memory, and displacement through text and image\nAs PhD candidate in the project you will explore how ceramic-making relates to histories of violence and displacement, while also fostering new forms of belonging and ownership. The project focuses on Bolesławiec pottery -- a craft taken over by resettled Poles when Germans were expelled from Silesia after 1945. Today internationally renowned, the pottery remains entangled with memories of loss and appropriation, political change, and legal contest.\nYou will work closely with the principal investigator and a small research team, including a research assistant and partner institutions in Poland and Germany. By bringing filming and editing skills to the project, you will complement the PI’s sociological expertise enabling a productive exchange between visual and social scientific approaches, artistic and analytical sensibilities, shaping a truly interdisciplinary research process. Together, we will develop new ways of understanding that unite social scientific rigor with the affective language of visual storytelling.\nYou will produce a practice-based dissertation of 70.000 words. You will write academic articles and experiment with visual forms of knowledge: an essay-film and a contribution to mounting a public exhibition of the pottery using objects as well as film. You will build an academic and professional network among researchers, artists, and museum specialists.\nA typical day may include filming a ceramist at work, conducting an interview about the style and technique, or analyzing how museum professionals present objects to the public, emphasizing and re-articulating some aspects of their provenance and the historical context over others. The project’s public-facing outputs offer you the unique opportunity to reach audiences inside and beyond academia, and gain experience in curating and visual storytelling.\nWhat are you going to do\n- Take part in training activities, colloquia, and seminars offered by the Graduate School of Social Sciences at the University of Amsterdam;\n- Carry out ethnographic research in Poland and Germany, including filming and interviewing ceramists and museum professionals.

This position is part of the ERC Synergy-funded research programme BLOCKADE, which explores the global blockades of the First and Second World Wars, and their aftermaths. A cooperation between the universities of Trondheim, Hamburg, Freiburg and Amsterdam, BLOCKADE sets out to prove that these blockades are crucial to understanding not only the way the world wars were fought but also their globality and totality, their immediate effects and their long-term global repercussions. More information can be found on the project website:\nhttps://blockades.eu/\n.\nJoin our team!\nThis PhD project will focus on the interwar period. Following the experiences of economic warfare during the First World War, blockades and sanctions became tools wielded by the League of Nations (LoN) and by others on behalf of an ‘international community’ to combat infractions of international law. Examples include sanctions levied against Japan following its invasion of Manchuria and against Italy following that of Ethiopia, as well as the multinational non-intervention committee set up to isolate both camps in the Spanish Civil War. Your PhD will focus on the interaction between the international level (and the development of thinking on the ethics and efficacy of using sanctions and blockades in the interest, however defined, of political aims) and one or more concrete case studies of interwar blockades. You will focus on the operation of blockades, their interaction with economic, diplomatic/legal and military measures taken by the belligerents, criteria for success or failure, and their economic, social, political and/or cultural impacts.

Do you enjoy the puzzle of data analysis with societal relevance? You might be the ideal PhD candidate to join our team!\nWe are looking for a highly motivated PhD candidate to assess how regenerative practices influence carbon and nitrogen cycling in farmers’ fields. This PhD position will explore how and under which biophysical and socioeconomic conditions farmers benefit from regenerative practices (by improved soil fertility, yields and/or income) and related environmental impacts (for example changes in soil carbon and/or reduced nitrogen losses). Research methods will include statistical analyses, modelling and potentially farm interviews.\nYour team\nTogether with pioneering Dutch farmers, the ReGeNL project is working to build an agricultural sector in which food production goes hand in hand with soil health, nature restoration, and a viable business model for farmers. By 2030, the project will draw on the experiences of 100 pioneering farmers to support around 1,000 farmers in the Netherlands in transitioning to regenerative practices, with the ambition of making regenerative agriculture the new norm by 2040.\nWithin ReGeNL, you will join work package 3B which develops predictive models at various scales. In 3B, a wide range of topics will be modelled to identify which combinations of practices deliver positive agricultural, socio-economic, and environmental outcomes.

        "description": "<em><strong>Do you have a background in agronomy, soil science or environmental science and would you like to contribute to more sustainable agricultural systems? Do you enjoy the puzzle of data analysis with societal relevance? You might be the ideal PhD candidate to join our team!</strong></em><br><br>We are looking for a highly motivated PhD candidate to assess how regenerative practices influence carbon and nitrogen cycling in farmers’ fields. This PhD position will explore how and under which biophysical and socioeconomic conditions farmers benefit from regenerative practices (by improved soil fertility, yields and/or income) and related environmental impacts (for example changes in soil carbon and/or reduced nitrogen losses). Research methods will include statistical analyses, modelling and potentially farm interviews.<br><br><strong>Your team</strong><br>Together with pioneering Dutch farmers, the ReGeNL project is working to build an agricultural sector in which food production goes hand in hand with soil health, nature restoration, and a viable business model for farmers. By 2030, the project will draw on the experiences of 100 pioneering farmers to support around 1,000 farmers in the Netherlands in transitioning to regenerative practices, with the ambition of making regenerative agriculture the new norm by 2040.<br><br>Within ReGeNL, you will join work package 3B which develops predictive models at various scales. In 3B, a wide range of topics will be modelled to identify which combinations of practices deliver positive agricultural, socio-economic, and environmental outcomes.

The porous structure of the membrane will be guaranteed by using a advanced foaming approach, that will also allow control over the membrane porosity and pore size. There will be a strong focus on connecting material properties to membrane performance.\nThe project is part of a larger NWO-VICI project, and as such the recruited PhD student will be expected to closely collaborate with at least 2 other PhD students and one postdoc within the project. While this PhD project will focus on sustainable membrane production, others will focus on advanced functionalities and on upscaling of these most promising membranes.

      "description_en": "The Faculty of Science and the Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science (LIACS) are looking for a:\nPhD Candidate in Emotionally and Socially Aware Natural Language Processing (1.0fte)\nProject description\nCurrent Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems, and especially large language models (LLMs), are interacting with human emotions more readily than earlier AI systems, but we still lack frameworks to understand and shape these interactions. These systems often reproduce and even enlarge social biases, generate toxic context, or do not respond safely to emotional cues. This is because language, in the training of these systems, is treated mainly as data rather than as a social practice shaped by people, culture, and context.\nThis PhD project investigates how to make NLP systems emotionally and socially aware. The goal is to move beyond accuracy by understanding how people engage with these systems and creating models that respond safely to emotional cues, respect cultural variation, and adapt to human interaction. This requires rethinking both what we measure and how we design models. The PhD candidate will:\n- Create datasets and benchmarks that capture emotional cues, conversational norms, and cultural variation beyond English;\n- Run user studies to understand how people perceive and collaborate with conversational AI, paying attention to trust, cultural sensitivity, and affective interaction;\n- Design methods and metrics to evaluate bias, fairness, inclusivity, safety, and emotional responsiveness;\n- Explore applications such as conversational agents, mental well-being, and education, where emotion safety is crucial;\n- Design interventions to reduce bias and improve fairness and safety in human-AI interaction.\nThe research will combine computational modeling (e.g., NLP, machine learning, deep learning) with human-centered research (e.g., user studies, experimental design, qualitative analysis). We are looking not only for technical skills, but also for curiosity about how people experience language technologies emotionally and socially, and how AI shapes these interactions. Background or interest in areas like bias and fairness, emotion and affective interaction, or user-centered evaluation will be a strong advantage.\nThe successful PhD candidate will be embedded in the Human AI cluster, at the Leiden Institute for Advanced Computer Science (LIACS) at Leiden University, supervised by Dr. Flor Miriam Plaza del Arco, Prof. Suzan Verberne and Prof. Joost Broekens. More information about the Human AI cluster can be found at\nhttps://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/science/computer-science/research/human-ai\n.\nKey responsibilities\n- Conduct original and novel research in the field of socially aware and trustworthy NLP;\n- Publish and present scientific articles in international conferences (e.g., ACL, EMNLP) and journals;\n- Collaborate with colleagues in interdisciplinary settings;\n- Assist in relevant teaching and supervision activities at LIACS;\n- Write a dissertation.\nSelection Criteria\n- A MSc degree in Computer Science, Natural Language Processing, Artificial Intelligence, Computational Linguistics or a related field;\n- Strong background in NLP, machine learning, and deep learning.\n- Excellent programming skills (preferably in Python), with experience in fine-tuning language models and working with deep learning frameworks (e.g., PyTorch);\n- Interest in interdisciplinary research (e.g., HCI, computational social science, affective computing);\n- Ability to work with a high degree of independence and eagerness to contribute your own ideas, and collaborating within a team;\n- Good writing and presentation skills;\n- Interested in contributing to educational activities and public engagement;\n- Excellent proficiency in English (oral and written).\nResearch at our faculty\nThe Faculty of Science is a world-class faculty where staff and students work together in a dynamic international environment.

It is part of activities in ARCNL’s Source Department. The research activities of the Source Department and its\nEUV Plasma Processes\ngroup aim at the atomic- and molecular-level understanding of the fundamental dynamics in the operation of contemporary and future plasma-based sources of extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) light for nanolithography.\nIn our group’s research we, for example, uncovered the quantum origins of the generated EUV light [Torretti, Nature Comms. Nature Commun.\n11\n, (2020)], found a universal law for expanding plasma [Sheil, Phys. Rev. Lett.\n133\n, (2024)], and found that less than half the initial droplet volume is present on thin tin sheet targets as used in EUV sources [Liu, Phys. Rev. Appl.\n20\n, (2023)], and work on an alternative EUV source solution [Mostafa, Appl. Phys. Lett.\n123\n, (2023)].\nBackground\nThe revolutionary introduction of EUV lithography was the culmination of several decades of collaborative work between industry and science – a Project Apollo of the digital age. The short, 13.5-nm EUV wavelength enables patterning the smallest, smartest, and most energy-efficient features on chips. The required 13.5-nm radiation is generated from plasma that is produced from tiny tin droplets that are heated by powerful laser pulses. At ARCNL, we are now thinking about the next generation of light sources: Can we make more efficient and more powerful EUV sources? Is it possible to make light sources that emit radiation efficiently at even shorter wavelengths?\nProject goal\nTo identify what light source will power the next generation of lithography machines, we need to understand what plasma conditions are optimal for producing light from plasma, but also we need to understand how such plasma should be generated, and what laser technology should be used. You will join an interdisciplinary team of several PhD students and postdocs in ARCNL’s highly cohesive Source Department and have as an objective to design & execute experiments, and work with advanced laser technologies, to understand the emission of light and ions from plasma that you generate.\nQualifications\n- You have (or will soon obtain) an MSc degree in (Applied) Physics\n- Knowledge of experimental laser physics and/or plasma and fluid mechanics is an asset, especially if combined with strong hands-on laboratory skills\n- Programming experience, particularly in Python, is welcomed\n- Strong verbal and written communication skills in English are required\nWork environment\nThe Advanced Research Center for Nanolithography (ARCNL) focuses on the fundamental physics and chemistry involved in current and future key technologies in nanolithography, primarily for the semiconductor industry.

      "description_en": "Would you like to investigate the underlying behavioral phenomenon for innovative designs of mixed fixed-flexible transport networks?\nJob description\nThe increase of public transport usage has clear potential in transforming our environment to be more liveable, sustainable and convenient. However, to ensure economic viability with off-peak times and relatively remote locations, while increasing the attractiveness to the users, we need innovative designs where fixed and flexible services support each other. This necessitates a multidisciplinary approach bringing together optimization, machine learning and behavioral modeling methodologies.\nIn FlexMobility we propose a holistic approach to design a public transport network that includes both traditional fixed lines and flexible on-demand services, while considering the underlying travel behaviour. To reach a user-centric public transport system we will also study how the demand would react to such a mixed system. We will do so by combining revealed preferences data on the already available systems together with stated preferences in tailored surveys for enriching the understanding of the mixed system. The behavioural understanding on the demand side will provide information to the supply side, such as the trade-offs between different attributes of the system, or the acceptable walking and waiting times, which will be used both to adapt the design and to have more realistic simulations. Supply and demand levels are intimately intertwined. While the chosen design has a significant effect on the most important aspects of users’ experience, the algorithms,\nand thus the supply decisions, are based on users’ preferences.\nThis PhD position within FlexMobility, will focus on the supply-demand interactions to guide the design of mixed fixed-flexible transport networks. This will start with the behavioral investigation based on the available data as well as the new survey data to be collected. The purpose of this first step will be to identify the key attributes of the transport system that influence the preferences of the users while accounting for the behavioral heterogeneity in the population. Methodologically, we might explore both random utility models as well as machine learning, potentially in a hybrid way, in onder to capture complex phenomenon. The behavioral understanding will guide the representation of supply-demand interactions in the next step. A baseline methodology will be an iterative process between supply and demand models, which will then be expanded towards endogenous representation of behavioral models in the network design problem. This integration of supply-demand interaction will build on optimization models of the transport network and will be enhanced with the behavioral representations. The decisions to be optimized could potentially exploit model-based learning approaches.\nIn this work, we will consider two use cases: (1) bus network considering both fixed-line buses and on-demand ones (2) a network with water-taxis which operate in fixed and flexible modes at different times of the day. For both use cases, there will be interaction with the project partners for generating/obtaining the needed data as well as for setting up realistic case studies.\nThe position is available as of October 1, 2025 with a flexible start date to be agreed upon. The PhD candidate will join the group of Bilge Atasoy, with various researchers working on adaptive transport and logistics systems through methodologies of dynamic and predictive optimization, behavioral modeling and machine learning. There is vivid interaction within the group to foster collaboration both with scientific and social activities. The PhD candidate will also interact with the group of Javier Alonso-Mora as part of the FlexMobility project as there will be in total 2 PhDs and 1 postdoctoral researcher working in a collaborative way to reach the goal of designing user-centric flexible transport networks. As part of the PhD position, there will be opportunities to gain teaching experience in the relevant courses and/or supervising MSc students.\nTU Delft (Delft University of Technology)\nDelft University of Technology is built on strong foundations.

      "description_en": "Are you interested in joining a collaborative team to study women’s migration from Southern Europe and Turkey to France and Germany in the post-World War II era, and the role of work in their trajectories? Passionate about archival research and oral history? Self-motivated and ready to learn new research skills?\nThe Department of History is looking for two PhD candidates to undertake archival and oral history research on women’s migration and work. You will be part of a new European Research Council-funded project entitled FeMMiWork: Women Migrants from the Northern Mediterranean and Work in Postwar Northwestern Europe.\nUsing a transnational lens that takes migrants’ countries both of origin and residence into account, FeMMiWork investigates the experiences of women who migrated from Italy, Yugoslavia, and Turkey to France and Germany in the 1950s-1970s and who engaged in paid work. In spite of their large numbers, their labour has been largely erased by policymakers and forgotten by researchers who focused on male labour migration. Drawing on archival sources and oral history, the project aims to understand what role paid work played in migrant women’s life trajectories, and in shaping relations with their communities of origin and destination. The project also aims to make the histories of these women visible by creating a ‘counter-archive’ using documents, oral histories, and creative writing.\nTwo PhDs are sought, one to document the trajectories of women from Italy, and one to do so for women from Turkey. Each PhD will be researching women who moved to Germany and to France. There is room, within this framework, to shape the PhD project in line with your own interests. You will be part of a collaborative and interdisciplinary team examining commonalities and differences across countries of origin (Italy, Turkey, and Yugoslavia) and destination countries (France and Germany). The team consists of the Principal Investigator (PI), Dr. Brigitte Le Normand, one postdoctoral researcher, a project manager, an ICT consultant, and two PhDs. The PI will research the case of women from Yugoslavia. The PI and post-doctoral researcher will additionally support the PhDs by carrying out research in French and German archives. The team will jointly address the project’s larger conceptual questions through reading groups, workshops, and collaborative writing projects.\nThe tasks include:\n- Developing a research plan, taking into consideration ethics and data management procedures of the Faculty;\n- Literature review of published sources including Italian or Turkish language, as relevant;\n- Archival research and oral history focused on the experiences of women migrants;\n- Participating in the development of a counter-archive of migrant working women;\n- Writing a doctoral dissertation and (co)authoring publications (e.g. peer-reviewed journal articles);\n- Participating in group meetings and contributing to the organization of events and workshops;\n- Presenting work-in-progress at international workshops, conference panels and to colleagues within the Faculty.\nIn this role you will learn to synthesize archival research and oral history while developing your writing and teamwork skills. Further trainings will be provided through the university Graduate School.\nThe position also includes 0.2 FTE teaching, which will allow you to develop your teaching skills and credentials.\nWhat we offer\nAs PhD candidate\nat Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences\n, you will be employed by the most international university in the Netherlands, located in the beautiful city of Maastricht. In addition, we offer you:\n- Good employment conditions. The position is graded in scale P according to UFO profile PhD, with corresponding salary based on experience ranging from €3059,00 and €3881,00 gross per month (based on a full-time employment of 38 hours per week). In addition to the monthly salary, an 8.0% holiday allowance and an 8.3% year-end bonus apply.\n- An employment contract for a period of 12 months with a scope of 1,0 FTE. Upon a positive evaluation, an extension of 3 years will follow.\n- At Maastricht University, the well-being of our employees is of utmost importance, we offer flexible working hours and the possibility to work partly from home if the nature of your position allows it. You will receive a monthly commuting and internet allowance for this. If you work full-time, you will be entitled to 29 vacation days and 4 additional public holidays per year, namely carnival Monday, carnival Tuesday, Good Friday, and Liberation Day. If you choose to accumulate compensation hours, an additional 12 days will be added.

      "description_en": "Join TU Delft and work together with NXP to build low-power AI accelerators for self-healing analog/RF calibration, fixing noise/offset. Co-design algorithms & hardware and validate on real silicon.\nJob description\nAs communication and sensing systems push towards higher frequencies and bandwidths (e.g., 6G, automotive radar), analog and RF front-ends are hitting a fundamental wall. In advanced CMOS nodes, it's incredibly difficult and power-hungry to design analog circuits that are perfectly linear, matched, and noise-free. The classic approach of over-designing the analog hardware is no longer sustainable.\nThis project pioneers a new paradigm: we design smart, low-power digital AI co-processors that learn and correct the imperfections of their analog counterparts in real-time. As a PhD researcher, you will:\n- Architect and design novel digital AI accelerators that directly target analog impairments in analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and power amplifier (PA).\n- Co-design algorithms and hardware with experts from TU Delft and NXP. You'll apply hardware-aware AI techniques (quantization, pruning) to create ultra-efficient solutions that fit a tight power and area budget.\n- Quantify real-world impact by benchmarking your silicon prototype against traditional DSP methods. You will measure system-level improvements on actual analog test chips in NXP's labs.\nYou will be supervised by Dr. Chang Gao and Prof. Leo de Vreede and have daily access to TU Delft’s state-of-the-art IC design infrastructure and support from Dr. Maarten Molendijk, Dr. Robert van Veldhoven at NXP Semiconductors in Eindhoven for design reviews and hands-on lab measurements.\nElectronic Circuits and Architectures (ELCA)\nJoin a pioneering research team dedicated to advancing the design and development of high-performance electronic circuits and systems. You will be part of the Electronic Circuits and Architectures (ELCA) section within the Department of Microelectronics at TU Delft. ELCA leads cutting-edge research in integrated circuit design, enhancing power efficiency, frequency performance, and functionality across RF, mm-wave, and wireless communication systems. The group bridges fundamental science with practical applications, pushing the boundaries of analog and digital circuit architectures.\nYou will have access to state-of-the-art design and testing facilities, including advanced fabrication technologies and specialized measurement labs. As part of a dynamic and interdisciplinary team, you will collaborate with experts in circuit design, signal processing, and emerging semiconductor technologies. The research environment fosters innovation through open collaboration and knowledge exchange. With strong mentorship, tailored training, and minimal hierarchical barriers, ELCA provides an ideal setting for academic and professional growth in the rapidly evolving field of electronic circuits and systems.\nTU Delft (Delft University of Technology)\nDelft University of Technology is built on strong foundations. As creators of the world-famous Dutch waterworks and pioneers in biotech, TU Delft is a top international university combining science, engineering and design. It delivers world class results in education, research and innovation to address challenges in the areas of energy, climate, mobility, health and digital society. For generations, our engineers have proven to be entrepreneurial problem-solvers, both in business and in a social context.\nAt TU Delft we embrace diversity as one of our core\nvalues\nand we actively\nengage\nto be a university where you feel at home and can flourish. We value different perspectives and qualities. We believe this makes our work more innovative, the TU Delft community more vibrant and the world more just. Together, we imagine, invent and create solutions using technology to have a positive impact on a global scale. That is why we invite you to apply. Your application will receive fair consideration.\nChallenge. Change. Impact!\nFaculty Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science\nThe Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science (EEMCS) brings together three scientific disciplines. Combined, they reinforce each other and are the driving force behind the technology we all use in our daily lives. Technology such as the electricity grid, which our faculty is helping to make completely sustainable and future-proof. At the same time, we are developing the chips and sensors of the future, whilst also setting the foundations for the software technologies to run on this new generation of equipment – which of course includes AI. Meanwhile we are pushing the limits of applied mathematics, for example mapping out disease processes using single cell data, and using mathematics to simulate gigantic ash plumes after a volcanic eruption. In other words: there is plenty of room at the faculty for ground-breaking research. We educate innovative engineers and have excellent labs and facilities that underline our strong international position. In total, more than 1000 employees and 4,000 students work and study in this innovative environment.\nClick\nhere\nto go to the website of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science.\nConditions of employment\nDoctoral candidates will be offered a 4-year period of employment in principle, but in the form of 2 employment contracts. An initial 1,5 year contract with an official go/no go progress assessment within 15 months. Followed by an additional contract for the remaining 2,5 years assuming everything goes well and performance requirements are met.\nSalary and benefits are in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities, increasing from € 3059 per month in the first year to € 3881 in the fourth year. As a PhD candidate you will be enrolled in the TU Delft Graduate School. The TU Delft Graduate School provides an inspiring research environment with an excellent team of supervisors, academic staff and a mentor. The Doctoral Education Programme is aimed at developing your transferable, discipline-related and research skills.\nThe TU Delft offers a customisable compensation package, discounts on health insurance, and a monthly work costs contribution.

The group has experience in teaching and conducting high quality research on consumer behaviour in NPD, consumers' perceptions of new product designs, and on improving the acceptance of new sustainable alternatives. By enhancing knowledge in these areas, we aim to help designers create more successful and sustainable product and services.\nA Circular Economy requires changes in consumer behaviour, such as adopting repair practices and purchasing refurbished products. However, consumers face barriers to adopting such circular behaviours. For repair, challenges include time, effort, lack of knowledge, high costs, availability of spare parts and perceived low product value. Repair and refurbishments are also met with scepticism, as consumers often associate it with lower quality and wear. As a result, repair is rarely considered, and refurbishment occupies a small share of the consumer market.\nThis PhD project will explore how AM can increase consumer adoption of repair and refurbishment, as AM offers unique opportunities for customization, fast and cost-effective repairs and enhanced product value. However, consumer perceptions of AM in repair and refurbishment contexts remain unclear, as does their likelihood of adopting these solutions based on product design integration. Accordingly, this PhD project aims to answer the following research questions:\n1) What motivators and barriers do consumers experience regarding AM-based repair and remanufacturing? and 2) Which design strategies will increase consumer adoption of AM-based repair and remanufacturing?\nTo answer these research questions, we expect to use a mixed-method approach, including both consumer research (qualitative and quantitative) and Research-through-Design (RtD).\nThis PhD project will be part of a larger, NWO-funded project on Additive Manufacturing in repair and remanufacturing (called ADD-ReAM), which includes, in total, 15 PhDs who focus on other aspects such as technical design aspects, logistics, sustainability assessment, consumer behaviour, and more.\nTU Delft (Delft University of Technology)\nDelft University of Technology is built on strong foundations.

      "description_en": "Are you an engineer who wants to contribute to sustainability, reducing carbon emissions, and materials recycling? We are looking for an outstanding and enthusiastic PhD candidate, with a strong computational mechanics profile, to work on a challenging micro-mechanical modelling project, in an exciting multidisciplinary team.\nInformation\nThe transition to low-carbon steelmaking will significantly alter production chains, starting from raw materials to high-end products made from these steels. One of the paths to reduce CO2 emissions in steelmaking is the use of scrap. This will inevitably entail significant variations in the chemical composition of the steel produced, which may affect the performance of the steels during processing and service. This is particularly true for stainless steels undergoing phase transformations in view of the targeted mechanical properties.\nThese phase transformations occur during the metal forming processes in which they are shaped to a product. These need to be well controlled to safeguard the formability of the material during processing on the one hand and securing the resulting strength and hardness properties on the other hand. This makes this class of materials particularly vulnerable to the use of recycled material, with possibly uncontrolled or variable content. Accordingly, this research project aims to establish predictive insights between microstructures contaminated with tramp elements and the resulting engineering properties as required for product processing.\nVacancy for a modelling-oriented PhD student on the\nConstitutive behaviour of recycled metastable stainless steel\nThis project will focus on a model-based approach, taking experimental input from the partners involved, to assess the influence of scrap-induced changes and contaminations on the performance of stainless steels that are subjected to phase transformations in the production chain. This approach will enable a qualitative and semi-quantitative assessment of the influence of the presence of various elements (and second-phase particles) on stainless steel properties. This step is essential for the introduction of green steels in the market segment exploiting such steels.\nThis work will consist of the following tasks:\n- Extensive literature review on the multi-scale model for strain-induced phase transformation of stainless steels and the influence of tramp elements and contaminations on the microstructure and mechanical behaviour of stainless steels.\n- Develop a multi-scale framework for strain-induced martensitic phase transformations applicable to austenitic metastable steels.\n- Incorporation of the phase transformation model in a representative volume element (RVE), incorporating crystal plasticity at the meso-scale level.\n- Homogenization of the RVE response for exploitation at the macroscopic level\n- Model extension to account for the presence of contaminations through either solid solution elements, precipitates or second-phase particles.\n- Validation of the macroscopic thermo-mechanical properties.\nSection Mechanics of Materials\nYou will work in the section of Mechanics of Materials (MoM) (\nwww.tue.nl/mechmat\n) at the department of Mechanical Engineering of Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e). The MoM section is recognized worldwide for its high-level research on experimental analysis, theoretical understanding and predictive modelling of complex mechanical behavior in engineering materials at different length scales (e.g, plasticity, damage, fracture), which emerges from the physics and mechanics of the underlying multi-phase microstructure. An integrated numerical-experimental approach is generally adopted for this goal. A state-of-the-art computing infrastructure is in place for the numerical work in this project.",

        "title": "PhD in Multiscale modelling of recycled stainless green steels",
        "description": "Are you an engineer who wants to contribute to sustainability, reducing carbon emissions, and materials recycling? We are looking for an outstanding and enthusiastic PhD candidate, with a strong computational mechanics profile, to work on a challenging micro-mechanical modelling project, in an exciting multidisciplinary team.<br><br><strong>Information</strong><br>The transition to low-carbon steelmaking will significantly alter production chains, starting from raw materials to high-end products made from these steels. One of the paths to reduce CO2 emissions in steelmaking is the use of scrap. This will inevitably entail significant variations in the chemical composition of the steel produced, which may affect the performance of the steels during processing and service. This is particularly true for stainless steels undergoing phase transformations in view of the targeted mechanical properties.<br><br>These phase transformations occur during the metal forming processes in which they are shaped to a product. These need to be well controlled to safeguard the formability of the material during processing on the one hand and securing the resulting strength and hardness properties on the other hand. This makes this class of materials particularly vulnerable to the use of recycled material, with possibly uncontrolled or variable content. Accordingly, this research project aims to establish predictive insights between microstructures contaminated with tramp elements and the resulting engineering properties as required for product processing.<br><br><strong>Vacancy for a modelling-oriented PhD student on the <em>Constitutive behaviour of recycled metastable stainless steel</em></strong><br>This project will focus on a model-based approach, taking experimental input from the partners involved, to assess the influence of scrap-induced changes and contaminations on the performance of stainless steels that are subjected to phase transformations in the production chain. This approach will enable a qualitative and semi-quantitative assessment of the influence of the presence of various elements (and second-phase particles) on stainless steel properties. This step is essential for the introduction of green steels in the market segment exploiting such steels.<br><br>This work will consist of the following tasks:<br><ul> <li>Extensive literature review on the multi-scale model for strain-induced phase transformation of stainless steels and the influence of tramp elements and contaminations on the microstructure and mechanical behaviour of stainless steels.</li> <li>Develop a multi-scale framework for strain-induced martensitic phase transformations applicable to austenitic metastable steels.</li> <li>Incorporation of the phase transformation model in a representative volume element (RVE), incorporating crystal plasticity at the meso-scale level.</li> <li>Homogenization of the RVE response for exploitation at the macroscopic level</li> <li>Model extension to account for the presence of contaminations through either solid solution elements, precipitates or second-phase particles.</li> <li>Validation of the macroscopic thermo-mechanical properties.</li>\n</ul>\n<br><strong>Section Mechanics of Materials</strong><br>You will work in the section of Mechanics of Materials (MoM) (<a href=\"http://www.tue.nl/mechmat\">www.tue.nl/mechmat</a>) at the department of Mechanical Engineering of Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e). The MoM section is recognized worldwide for its high-level research on experimental analysis, theoretical understanding and predictive modelling of complex mechanical behavior in engineering materials at different length scales (e.g, plasticity, damage, fracture), which emerges from the physics and mechanics of the underlying multi-phase microstructure. An integrated numerical-experimental approach is generally adopted for this goal. A state-of-the-art computing infrastructure is in place for the numerical work in this project.",

Do you want to bridge the gap between programming languages research and industry needs?\nIf you’re excited about tackling both deep research challenges and real-world software problems, this project is for you.\nSeeking a PhD student who values the strengths of formal reasoning while recognizing its current limitations —driven to explore solutions that go beyond what verification alone can achieve.\nThis PhD project focuses on developing analysis and program repair techniques that enhance software interoperability. For example, how can we restore Rust’s safety guarantees when integrating it with legacy C code? More generally, how can we ensure that software components written in different languages and by different authors, such as human developers and AI assistants, always interact according to their intended specification?\nThe project aims to create synergy between verification, analysis, and testing to repair faulty software and, in turn, enhance software trustworthiness.\nAbout the environment:\nWe want to create things -–and grow in ways-– that stay solid even when everything else is shifting. We value collaboration, and we also respect the need for focused, independent work. Academia gives us space to explore, but we also like teaming up with industry for fresh ideas and real-world impact.

Impact!\nFaculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science\nThe Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science (EEMCS) brings together three scientific disciplines. Combined, they reinforce each other and are the driving force behind the technology we all use in our daily lives. Technology such as the electricity grid, which our faculty is helping to make completely sustainable and future-proof. At the same time, we are developing the chips and sensors of the future, whilst also setting the foundations for the software technologies to run on this new generation of equipment – which of course includes AI. Meanwhile we are pushing the limits of applied mathematics, for example mapping out disease processes using single cell data, and using mathematics to simulate gigantic ash plumes after a volcanic eruption. In other words: there is plenty of room at the faculty for ground-breaking research. We educate innovative engineers and have excellent labs and facilities that underline our strong international position.

Your project will focus on developing new methods to understand how genetic variants affect not only individual brain cells but also change the way cells interact and communicate — insights that are essential for understanding the cellular origins of brain disorders.\nDespite major progress in genetics research, we still don’t know how genetic risk factors for brain disorders like schizophrenia, alzheimer, and depression disrupt brain function. Genetic discoveries point to thousands of disease-associated SNPs, but most of them act in subtle and cell type–specific ways, and their downstream biological effects remain poorly understood.\nThis project tackles this fundamental gap — by building computational models that simulate what goes wrong in the brain, one cell (and one cell–cell interaction) at a time.\nYou will work with large-scale single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data to develop and apply single-cell foundation models — generative machine learning models that represent the structure and variation of cell states. These models act as virtual cells simulating how perturbing the expression of genes altered by genetic variants affects the cell’s identity, behavior, and trajectory. You will extend these models to understand how genetic risk factors alter cell–cell communication networks. Spatial transcriptomics datasets will be used to anchor these models in real tissue context, revealing how spatially organized cell communities rewire under genetic perturbation.\nKey challenges\n- Use and improve single-cell foundation models to predict SNP-driven shifts in cell state and cell fate.\n- Integrate spatial transcriptomics data to anchor these predictions in tissue context.\n- Develop machine learning methods (e.g. graph neural networks, variational or diffusion models) to model cell–cell communication dynamics under genetic perturbation.\n- Investigate how local interactions between perturbed and unperturbed cells reshape signaling networks and tissue states.\n- Closely collobarate with neuroscientists in the BRAINSCAPES consortium to link model predictions to experimental and clinical relevance.\nBenefits\n- Shape next-generation models for understanding brain disease mechanisms.\n- Work in a collaborative, interdisciplinary, and dynamic environment with leading experts in machine learning, computational biology, and neurogenomics.\n- Access cutting-edge datasets, infrastructure, and computational and experimental facilities.\n- Receive support for professional development and participation in international conferences.\nTU Delft (Delft University of Technology)\nDelft University of Technology is built on strong foundations.

Instead of relying on virgin materials, we aim to recycle 316L stainless steel from decommissioned industrial components into powders suitable for additive manufacturing processes.\nThis PhD project will experimentally validate the use of recycled stainless steel powders in AM by:\n- Producing powders via gas atomization (with program partner Space XYZ) and ultrasonic atomization (TU Delft).\n- Characterizing powder morphology, flowability, oxidation, and contamination.\n- Fabricating parts using LPBF printing, optimizing process parameters for recycled feedstock.\n- Benchmarking mechanical properties (tensile strength, elongation, hardness) against commercial powders.\n- Identifying industrial applications for recycled AM parts in sectors such as aerospace, medical, automotive, and marine.\nYou’ll work with TU Delft’s state-of-the-art facilities, including:\n- Powder analysis: SEM, laser diffraction, flowmeter, XPS, LECO, EDS.\n- Additive manufacturing: LPBF and Binder Jetting printers, post-processing tools.\n- Mechanical testing: tensile, hardness, nanoindentation, in-situ testing.\n- Microstructural analysis: optical microscopy, SEM, EBSD, XRD.\nThe expected start date is December 2025 (but can be later, depending on the candidate's availability and immigration procedures); the contract duration is 4 years.\nTU Delft (Delft University of Technology)\nDelft University of Technology is built on strong foundations.

      "description_en": "Word jij de onderzoeker die de verborgen rijkdom van Nederlandse buitenplaatsen in kaart brengt? Verbind erfgoed, landschap en data in een uniek promotieproject.\nFunctieomschrijving\nNederland kent nog altijd veel historische buitenplaatsen, kastelen en landgoederen, die diep verweven zijn met het landschap. Deze buitenplaatslandschappen vormen unieke culturele, landschappelijke en ecologische systemen, maar hun toekomst staat onder druk door klimaatverandering, verstedelijking en veranderend gebruik.\nOm dit waardevolle erfgoed te behouden en toekomstbestendig te maken, is overzicht en actuele kennis onmisbaar. Hoe kun je immers beschermen wat je niet kent? Daarom slaan de TU Delft en de Vereniging Particuliere Historische Buitenplaatsen (VPHB) de handen ineen voor de Landelijke Inventarisatie Particuliere Historische Buitenplaatsen: een promotieonderzoek dat een compleet en gedetailleerd overzicht ontwikkelt van particuliere complex historische buitenplaatsen en informatie samenbrengt over hun ruimtelijke opbouw en gebruik.\nHet onderzoek start met de circa 200 buitenplaatsen binnen de VPHB en wordt later uitgebreid naar buitenplaatsen in de rest van Nederland. Deze zijn zorgvuldig ontworpen ensembles van gebouwen, tuinen en groenstructuren. Ze bestaan doorgaans uit een (voormalig) versterkt huis, kasteel, buiten- of landhuis met bijgebouwen, omgeven door tuinen, grachten, lanen, parken, (sier)weiden, waterpartijen en moestuinen. Samen vormen deze onderdelen een historisch gegroeid geheel waarin de wisselwerking tussen cultuur, natuur en ontwerp centraal staat.\nAls promovendus speel jij een sleutelrol in dit project. Je brengt particuliere buitenplaatsen systematisch in kaart en bouwt aan een GIS-gebaseerde digitale database die inzicht biedt in ligging, gebruik, eigendom en ruimtelijke structuur. Hiervoor ontwikkel je een enquête die via persoonlijke interviews met particuliere eigenaren wordt afgenomen. De verkregen informatie vormt de basis voor de database, die je structureert, analyseert en visualiseert. Daarbij besteed je bijzondere aandacht aan de individuele buitenplaats, de historische groenaanleg en de manier waarop deze binnen bredere buitenplaatslandschappen functioneren.\nNaast dit empirische werk ontwikkel je een wetenschappelijke methode en theoretisch kader voor het analyseren en representeren van buitenplaatslandschappen. Je onderzoekt hoe digitale kartering, data-integratie en landschapsanalyse kunnen bijdragen aan het behoud, beheer en toekomstgerichte ontwikkeling van dit particuliere erfgoed.\nHet project vindt plaats in nauwe samenwerking met de VPHB, die toegang biedt tot een groot netwerk van particuliere eigenaren en buitenplaatsen. Je werkt binnen een interdisciplinair team met expertise in landschapsarchitectuur, cultuurgeschiedenis en erfgoedbeheer, verbonden aan de TU Delft, de Rijksuniversiteit Groningen en de Radboud Universiteit.\nBinnen deze context krijg je ruimte voor eigen initiatief, verdieping en samenwerking. Je draagt bij aan de ontwikkeling van een digitale kennisinfrastructuur die niet alleen wetenschappelijke inzichten oplevert, maar ook praktische waarde heeft voor beleid, beheer en toekomstig onderzoek.\nTot je werkzaamheden behoren het ontwikkelen van een methodologie voor dataverzameling, kartering en analyse, en het ontwerpen en uitvoeren van een enquête die via persoonlijke interviews met particuliere eigenaren wordt afgenomen. Je bouwt en beheert een GIS-database met ruimtelijke en beschrijvende gegevens, voert analyses en visualisaties uit, en vertaalt de resultaten naar wetenschappelijke publicaties en je proefschrift. Daarnaast presenteer je bevindingen aan academische en maatschappelijke partners en draag je actief bij aan kennisdeling binnen de VPHB en aan een publieksgerichte digitale kaart.\nJe maakt deel uit van de Sectie Landschapsarchitectuur, met een sterke onderzoekstraditie in buitenplaatsen en innovatieve technologie. In deze internationale omgeving versterken landschapsarchitectuur, erfgoed en technologie elkaar, en draag jij bij aan inzicht in hoe particuliere buitenplaatsen functioneren en duurzaam kunnen worden beheerd .\nFunctie-eisen\n- Achtergrond in een relavant domein zoals landschapsarchitectuur, erfgoedstudies, geografie, planologie, landschapsgeschiedenis of een verwante discipline.\n- Ervaring met ruimtelijke analyse, databewerking en/of erfgoedonderzoek.\n- Interesse in de relatie tussen landschap, erfgoed en eigendom, en in de rol van particuliere buitenplaatsen in ruimtelijke kwaliteit en beleid.\n- Vaardig met GIS (bijv. ArcGIS, QGIS) en databases.\n- Goede communicatieve vaardigheden en gevoelig voor menselijke en institutionele relaties.\n- Bekend met wetenschappelijke methoden voor dataverzameling en analyse, en bij voorkeur met interviewtechnieken, cartografische visualisatie of landschapsanalyse.\n- In staat om samen te werken in een interdisciplinair team, initiatief te nemen en resultaatgericht te werken.\n- Uitstekende beheersing van de Nederlandse taal (mondeling en schriftelijk) en goede kennis van het Engels.\nTU Delft\nDe Technische Universiteit Delft heeft een sterk fundament. Als bouwer van de wereldberoemde Nederlandse waterwerken en pionier in biotech is TU Delft een internationale topuniversiteit die wetenschap, engineering en design combineert. TU Delft staat voor onderwijs, onderzoek en innovatie van wereldklasse om uitdagingen op het gebied van energie, klimaat, mobiliteit, gezondheid en digitale maatschappij aan te gaan. Generaties Delftse ingenieurs hebben bewezen ondernemende probleemoplossers te zijn in bedrijfsleven en in sociale context.\nBij TU Delft omarmen we diversiteit als een van onze\nkernwaarden\nen\nzetten we ons actief in\nom een universiteit te zijn waar jij je thuis voelt en kunt floreren. We hechten veel waarde aan verschillende perspectieven en kwaliteiten, omdat wij geloven dat dit ons werk innovatiever, de TU Delft-gemeenschap levendiger en de wereld rechtvaardiger maakt.

You will perform experiments, develop dose-response models and mechanistic understanding allowing to develop a workflow allowing understanding and awareness amongst different stakeholders. You will be embedded in the Environmental Biology Department, which is part of the Institute for Environmental Sciences at the Faculty of Science at Leiden University.\nDescription of research:\nThe application of nanotechnology in medicine, provides tremendous opportunities either to improve existing therapies or enable entirely new treatments for a range of debilitating diseases, including cancer and genetic disorders. Especially in the field of drug delivery, nanomedicines (NM) have shown effectiveness by increasing the therapeutic index of existing drugs or enabling macromolecular drugs to overcome biological barriers. Despite these success stories, there are still quite some roadblocks that limit the full potential and breadth of NM in treating a variety of diseases. From the perspective of (eco)toxicology we are talking mainly about substances that are problematic in light of their poor degradability, high toxicity or tendency to accumulate at non-targeted sites. The Environmental Risk Assessment framework developed within our group gives tools to determine exposure as well as potential effects, allowing risk characterization.\nThe PhD project is part of a national effort (NanoMedNL) to create novel nanomedicines for the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of patients. The PhD student will collaborate with and contribute to this multidisciplinary consortium.\nWhat you will do\nWe will establish a workflow for the investigation of the release and potential short-term and long-term impacts of nanomedicines and their degradation products on a representative battery of non-target species (e.g. culturable microbes from a representative host, some standard low tier laboratory species like daphnids, algae). Experiments on fate within the relevant exposure medium, as well as uptake and effects will be executed. The assessment will follow a tiered approach adding realism and complexity into the testing: from standard OECD lab tests to disentanglement of mechanisms of toxicity including biotransformation and degradation of nanomedicines towards a quantitative assessment with more complex testing, enhancing the human and ecological relevance. This tiered approach gives support to environmental risk assessment for these new classes of medicines from the design phase onwards. It should integrate awareness and risk-benefit considerations.\nKey responsibilities\n- Complete a PhD thesis within the official appointment duration of four year\nComplete a PhD thesis within the official appointment duration of four year\n- Investigate novel nano-embedded carriers of medicines and publish about dose-effect relationships and mechanisms of uptake, biodistribution and effects.\nInvestigate novel nano-embedded carriers of medicines and publish about dose-effect relationships and mechanisms of uptake, biodistribution and effects.\n- Collaborate with a variety of stakeholders, so that together standardized workflows and understanding can be established.\nCollaborate with a variety of stakeholders, so that together standardized workflows and understanding can be established.\n- Discuss your work in our group meetings, incorporate feedback, and give input to others\nDiscuss your work in our group meetings, incorporate feedback, and give input to others\n- Assist in writing the deliverable of the tiered approach for the determination of nanomedicine environmental impact based on your scientific achievements.\nAssist in writing the deliverable\nof the tiered approach for the determination of nanomedicine environmental impact based on your scientific achievements.\nWhere you will work\nLeiden University is situated between Amsterdam (36 km) and The Hague (15 km) and was founded in 1575, making it the oldest university in the Netherlands.

The candidate will be part of an international network of top universities and renowned scholars within the field, supervised by Prof. Gaby Odekerken-Schroeder and Prof. Dominik Mahr.\nYour colleagues:\nAI and robots can do a lot of good in healthcare, but only if they are built with the people who use and are affected by it: patients, nurses, doctors, data teams, and communities. This PhD focuses on the skills those people need to work well together (listening, facilitation, ethics, data basics, cultural sensitivity) so that AI is fair, safe, and useful in both high-resource and low-resource settings around the world.\nYou will map where co-creation breaks down today and why, identify the essential skills different stakeholders need, and design training that works in practice (from simple workshop tools to digital and VR exercises). Together with a sister PhD (DC3), you’ll help create an online learning community and clear protocols so healthcare organisations and partners can apply co-creation consistently across projects and contexts.\nThis is an academic, hands-on, international project. You will co-design, test, and improve the training with real users, then evaluate what people learn and how it changes outcomes. You’ll also translate results into practical recommendations for healthcare managers and policymakers. Affiliated with the Department of Marketing & Supply Chain Management (\nMSCM\n), the candidate will have access to excellent resources and state-of-the-art digital lab facilities like the\nSBE DEXlab\nand the Maastricht Center for Robots (\nMCR\n).\nWhat you do – specific research objectives\n- Identify gaps and obstacles caused by a lack of co-creation skills that hinder the recognition of the public value of social justice in AI for healthcare, both locally and globally. Identify the essential co-creation skills needed for integrating the expertise and backgrounds of stakeholders in the healthcare ecosystem, in both the Global North and the Global South. Determine the most suitable training strategies and content to enhance these skills. In collaboration with DC3, develop protocols that define a set of strategies and methods to build co-creation skills, to be implemented throughout the project in support of a robust co-creation approach.\n- Develop training strategies, methods, content, and materials tailored to the healthcare ecosystem in both the Global North and Global South, aimed at strengthening co-creation capabilities. Establish an online platform that incorporates cutting-edge digital technologies to facilitate communication and learning among a global community of stakeholders. In collaboration with DC3, explore how this learning community can foster the development of co-creation processes and skills in the challenging global context.\n- Open the above-mentioned platform to all stakeholders involved in the pilot actions, both in the West and the Global South. Test and validate the training strategies, methods, content, and materials by delivering targeted training initiatives to pilot participants. Validation will include collecting action reviews after the training and assessing learning outcomes and proficiency levels among DCs and stakeholders.\n- Support the identification of conditions for the transferability of the Framework and other project outputs by identifying the co-creation skills required for application in other healthcare contexts. Develop recommendations for decision-makers and policy-makers that emphasize the critical role of co-creation skills. All in collaboration with other projects.\nExpected results:\n- Defined set of co-creation skills for the global healthcare innovation ecosystem\n- Establishment of a learning community to foster continuous exchange and development\n- Blended training approach, combining non-digital and digital methods\n- Use of state-of-the-art training tools, including online communities and virtual reality environments\nIndicative planned secondments -\nInstitution, place and timing\n- Altuïtion BV ('s-Hertogenbosch, Netherlands); Nov. – Dec. 2026\n- University of Cape Town (Cape Town, South Africa); Feb. – Apr. 2027; Apr. – May 2028\n- Path Check Inc (Cambridge, USA); Mar. – Apr. 2029\nFurther analysis might be required, based on the development of a research project.\nWhat you bring\nWe seek candidates who are driven by a genuine passion for academic research and aspire to contribute to the research project’s topics.\n- Exhibit a strong research orientation and academic motivation\n- Hold a Master’s degree (preferably 120 ECTS)\n- Show familiarity with research methods\n- Demonstrate proficiency in the English language\nMarie Curie mobility rules do apply\n:\ncandidates should not have worked or studied in the host country for more than 12 months in the last three years.\nDesirable requirements:\n- Prior experience with quantitative and/or qualitative research methods; familiarity with software such as R, Python, SPSS, or NVivo is a plus\n- Strong motivation for pursuing an academic career, with the intention to publish in international peer-reviewed journals\n- Ability to work independently while also being a collaborative team player in a diverse and international environment\n- Willingness to engage with industry partners, research institutes and interdisciplinary initiatives\nSelection criteria:\nAll eligible applications will be assessed by a Selection panel according to the following criterion “Qualifications and previous experience” and related sub-criteria with equal weight:\n- Qualifications and previous experience (50,0 point score)\nQuality of academic performance , Current knowledge and expertise, Relevant research skills, Motivation to apply, Good command of Dutch.\n- Communication and Personal skills (0-70,0 point score)\nAbility to design and conduct original research in the subject area of the individual research project, Excellent oral communication in English, Enthusiasm, proactivity, creativity and commitment, Interpersonal skills, Attitude to team working and in working in local and international setting, Expected impact of the doctorate on the DC’s future career, Ability to interact with Dutch speaking people.\nWhat we offer\nAs PhD Candidate co-creation skills for decolonized, just and trustworthy ai in healthcare\nat School of Business and Economics\n, you will be employed by the most international university in the Netherlands, located in the beautiful city of Maastricht.

This PhD focuses on the skills those people need to work well together (listening, facilitation, ethics, data basics, cultural sensitivity) so that AI is fair, safe, and useful in both high-resource and low-resource settings around the world.<br><br>You will map where co-creation breaks down today and why, identify the essential skills different stakeholders need, and design training that works in practice (from simple workshop tools to digital and VR exercises). Together with a sister PhD (DC3), you’ll help create an online learning community and clear protocols so healthcare organisations and partners can apply co-creation consistently across projects and contexts.<br><br>This is an academic, hands-on, international project. You will co-design, test, and improve the training with real users, then evaluate what people learn and how it changes outcomes. You’ll also translate results into practical recommendations for healthcare managers and policymakers. Affiliated with the Department of Marketing &amp; Supply Chain Management (<a href=\"https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/research/department-marketing-and-supply-chain-management-mscm\">MSCM</a>), the candidate will have access to excellent resources and state-of-the-art digital lab facilities like the <a href=\"https://www.sbe-dexlab.com/\">SBE DEXlab</a> and the Maastricht Center for Robots (<a href=\"https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/research/maastricht-center-robots\">MCR</a>).<br><br><strong> <br>What you do – specific research objectives </strong><br><ul> <li>Identify gaps and obstacles caused by a lack of co-creation skills that hinder the recognition of the public value of social justice in AI for healthcare, both locally and globally. Identify the essential co-creation skills needed for integrating the expertise and backgrounds of stakeholders in the healthcare ecosystem, in both the Global North and the Global South. Determine the most suitable training strategies and content to enhance these skills. In collaboration with DC3, develop protocols that define a set of strategies and methods to build co-creation skills, to be implemented throughout the project in support of a robust co-creation approach.</li> <li>Develop training strategies, methods, content, and materials tailored to the healthcare ecosystem in both the Global North and Global South, aimed at strengthening co-creation capabilities. Establish an online platform that incorporates cutting-edge digital technologies to facilitate communication and learning among a global community of stakeholders. In collaboration with DC3, explore how this learning community can foster the development of co-creation processes and skills in the challenging global context.</li> <li>Open the above-mentioned platform to all stakeholders involved in the pilot actions, both in the West and the Global South. Test and validate the training strategies, methods, content, and materials by delivering targeted training initiatives to pilot participants. Validation will include collecting action reviews after the training and assessing learning outcomes and proficiency levels among DCs and stakeholders.</li> <li>Support the identification of conditions for the transferability of the Framework and other project outputs by identifying the co-creation skills required for application in other healthcare contexts. Develop recommendations for decision-makers and policy-makers that emphasize the critical role of co-creation skills.

At the University of Amsterdam, we are looking for a PhD candidate who will use state-of-the-art techniques to investigate how the shape and aggregation of proteins is influenced by their interaction with nanoparticles.\nFinding out how proteins interact with nanoparticles\nPlastic nanoparticles are everywhere, including in our own bodies, and there is increasing evidence that these nanoparticles affect our health. The biological effects of nanoparticles are ultimately due to their interaction with proteins. However, very little is known about the underlying nanoplastic-protein interactions that give rise to these biological effects. In this project, you will use advanced spectroscopy methods to investigate how plastic nanoparticles change the shape and aggregation behavior of proteins. This project will be done in collaboration with prof. Mireille Claessens (WUR), dr. Ioana Ilie (UvA) and dr. Alberto Pérez de Alba Ortíz (UvA).\nThis is what you are going to do\n- You will set up and perform experiments on nanoparticles and proteins using spectroscopy methods, in particular two-dimensional and diffusion-ordered optical spectroscopy\n- You will learn to quantitatively analyze the multidimensional data sets resulting from your experiments\n- You will cooperate with computer-simulation and biophysics research groups to interpret your data\n- You will report your results in peer-reviewed journals and at international conferences\nThis is what we ask of you\n- A MSc degree in physics or chemistry\n- Good communication skills in oral and written English\n- Experience with spectroscopy and/or soft matter is an advantage (but not required)\n- Your interest in the specific topic of the research project should be explained in your application (otherwise you might not receive an answer to your application)\nThis is what we offer you\nA temporary contract for 38 hours per week for the duration of 4 years (the initial contract will be for a period of 18 months and after satisfactory evaluation it will be extended for a total duration of 4 years).

      "description_en": "The PhD will develop AI methods and approaches to enable accurate characterization of metal scrap, for more efficient metal recovery and recycling\nJob description\nThe volume of available metal scrap is steadily increasing, driven by rising end-of-life products, recycling opportunities, and growing industrial turnover. As this secondary resource becomes more abundant and diverse, it presents both a challenge and a strategic opportunity for circular metallurgy. Efficient and advanced recycling of scrap is critical to meet the growing demand for metals in a resource-constrained world and reduce their environmental footprint.In this context, the optimization of material recovery from end-of-life vehicle scrap is challenged not only by the heterogeneous and evolving nature of this scrap, but also by the diverse operational constraints and economic motivations across the value chain.\nTo address these challenges, the project will develop multi-modal artificial intelligence methods to characterize metal scrap composition with unprecedented detail, enabling dynamic, data-driven insight into the recoverable value of materials. Agentic AI systems will be designed to autonomously explore and propose optimal dismantling, sorting, and processing routes tailored to specific scrap streams. These intelligent agents will integrate scrap data and industry constraints to recommend strategies that maximize resource recovery and economic return. Together, these AI-driven tools will serve as a foundation for decision-making platforms that guide industry stakeholders toward more efficient, profitable, and sustainable recycling practices across the circular steel ecosystem.\nThis PhD position is part of the Groeien met Groen Staal program from the Dutch national growth fund (https://groeienmetgroenstaal.nl). The Groein met Groen Staal program is the enabler of a revolution in green steel production at national and international arenas. It will develop solutions to overcome technical, economic and societal bottlenecks towards the following overarching goals: i) Making Dutch steel sector a leader in sustainable steel; ii) Quadrupling of scrap sorting activities; iii) Tripling of steel reuse and remanufacturing activities; iv) Reducing dependence on foreign steel/iron ore through scrap recycling; v) Reducing industry CO2 emissions by 30% and reduce other emissions (including nitrogen oxides and particulate matter) by 50%.\nThe project contributes to reaching this overarching objective by enabling increased: i) cost/energy efficiency in recycling/recovery of metals from scrap, ii) scrap value, iii) recycled scrap amounts, iv) amounts of recovered critical elements.\nThis PhD position is also part of the interdisciplinary Climate Safety & Security centre (CaSS) at TU Delft | Campus The Hague. This centre runs an ambitious and comprehensive programme that considers climate change and stability in an integrated manner, with focus on human security, security of supply of fundamental needs (water, food) and essential resources (energy, critical materials). The PhD will contribute to the flagship materials security within CaSS. The successful candidate will have the opportunity to collaborate with researchers from across TU Delft, as well as policy makers from (inter)national governments and organisations in The Hague and beyond.\nFor more information on the TU Delft | Climate Safety & Security centre see:\nwww.tudelft.nl/en/campusthehague/research/cass\n.\nTU Delft (Delft University of Technology)\nDelft University of Technology is built on strong foundations.

        "description": "<strong><em>The PhD will develop AI methods and approaches to enable accurate characterization of metal scrap, for more efficient metal recovery and recycling</em></strong><br><br><strong>Job description</strong><br>The volume of available metal scrap is steadily increasing, driven by rising end-of-life products, recycling opportunities, and growing industrial turnover. As this secondary resource becomes more abundant and diverse, it presents both a challenge and a strategic opportunity for circular metallurgy. Efficient and advanced recycling of scrap is critical to meet the growing demand for metals in a resource-constrained world and reduce their environmental footprint.In this context, the optimization of material recovery from end-of-life vehicle scrap is challenged not only by the heterogeneous and evolving nature of this scrap, but also by the diverse operational constraints and economic motivations across the value chain.<br><br>To address these challenges, the project will develop multi-modal artificial intelligence methods to characterize metal scrap composition with unprecedented detail, enabling dynamic, data-driven insight into the recoverable value of materials. Agentic AI systems will be designed to autonomously explore and propose optimal dismantling, sorting, and processing routes tailored to specific scrap streams. These intelligent agents will integrate scrap data and industry constraints to recommend strategies that maximize resource recovery and economic return. Together, these AI-driven tools will serve as a foundation for decision-making platforms that guide industry stakeholders toward more efficient, profitable, and sustainable recycling practices across the circular steel ecosystem.<br><br>This PhD position is part of the Groeien met Groen Staal program from the Dutch national growth fund (https://groeienmetgroenstaal.nl). The Groein met Groen Staal program is the enabler of a revolution in green steel production at national and international arenas. It will develop solutions to overcome technical, economic and societal bottlenecks towards the following overarching goals: i) Making Dutch steel sector a leader in sustainable steel; ii) Quadrupling of scrap sorting activities; iii) Tripling of steel reuse and remanufacturing activities; iv) Reducing dependence on foreign steel/iron ore through scrap recycling; v) Reducing industry CO2 emissions by 30% and reduce other emissions (including nitrogen oxides and particulate matter) by 50%.<br><br>The project contributes to reaching this overarching objective by enabling increased: i) cost/energy efficiency in recycling/recovery of metals from scrap, ii) scrap value, iii) recycled scrap amounts, iv) amounts of recovered critical elements.<br><br>This PhD position is also part of the interdisciplinary Climate Safety &amp; Security centre (CaSS) at TU Delft | Campus The Hague. This centre runs an ambitious and comprehensive programme that considers climate change and stability in an integrated manner, with focus on human security, security of supply of fundamental needs (water, food) and essential resources (energy, critical materials).

Although it is one of the fastest-growing renewable energy sources globally, the targeted threefold increase of installed generation capacity until 2030 will be challenging to meet. Airborne wind energy (AWE) is an emerging technology that can complement conventional turbines while reducing the material consumption and environmental impact of energy generation.\nThis PhD project is part of the MSCA Doctoral Network AWETRAIN (Airborne Wind Energy TRAining for Industrialization Network). Its objective is to investigate the optimal configuration for utility-scale AWE farms, considering the physics, economics, and environmental impact. To determine the optimal scaling strategies for kite farms, a toolchain comprising a statistical description of the wind resource and physics-based models of the AWE system will be combined with a cost model of the farm. Is it better to scale up the individual systems or to combine multiple smaller-scale systems into a farm? The cost model will be augmented with a life cycle analysis to incorporate the environmental impact of the used materials into the analysis. All relevant interaction mechanisms between the individual AWE systems of the farm will be taken into account. Many components of this toolchain already exist and have been validated for smaller-scale AWE systems (\nhttps://github.com/awegroup/\n).\nThe main activities of this project will be: i) combining wind resource statistics with a physics-based system engineering model, focused on kite design and nominal operation, using this toolchain for preliminary optimization of AWE devices and plants based on physical metrics, ii) adding a cost model for AWE farms, and using this for preliminary optimization of AWE systems and farms based on economic metrics, iii) extending the cost model with data on environmental impact from life cycle analysis, using this for optimization of AWE devices and plants based on combinations of physical, economic and environmental metrics.\nYou will be a member of the Wind Energy Section’s Airborne Wind Energy Research Group, a leading academic player in the AWE sector, and will collaborate with two fellow AWETRAIN PhD researchers in Delft: one with the neighboring Faculty of Technology, Policy and Management (TPM) and one with the research group's spin-off company Kitepower B.V. You will also have the opportunity to meet regularly and collaborate with the other PhD researchers of the AWETRAIN Doctoral Network (\nhttps://awetrain.eu\n) that are located all across Europe. This will include secondments to industry partners.\nEligibility criteria\nFulfillment of eligibility criteria is dictated by the European Commission under the Horizon MSCA Doctoral Networks Programme. We welcome applications from PhD candidates from any country fulfilling the following mobility criteria:\n- Eligible candidates must not have resided or carried out their main activity (work, studies, etc.) in the country of their first host institution for more than 12 months in the 3 years immediately before their recruitment by the host institution (i.e., the starting date indicated in the employment contract/equivalent direct contract).\n- Eligible candidates must have a master’s degree relevant to the chosen position or its equivalent that would entitle them to a doctorate, awarded before the start of the position.\nTU Delft (Delft University of Technology)\nDelft University of Technology is built on strong foundations. As creators of the world-famous Dutch waterworks and pioneers in biotech, TU Delft is a top international university combining science, engineering and design.

Are you passionate about hydrogeological system understanding and sustainable groundwater management under a changing climate? Do you want to be part of an interdisciplinary research team? Then we may have the perfect opportunity for you!\nWe are looking for a proactive and self-motivated PhD candidate to join our NWO-funded Coast-Water-Solutions project team (4 years, full-time, fully funded) based at the Hydrology and Environmental Hydraulics Group (HWM) at Wageningen University to conduct a comprehensive hydrogeological assessment of the coastal zone of Bangladesh to enhance understanding of water availability and inform effective groundwater management strategies.\nCoast-Water-Solutions project: Most large deltas (70%), including the Ganges–Brahmaputra–Meghna (GBM) delta, are under a constant threat of groundwater overexploitation, salt-water intrusion, freshwater availability, land subsidence, and pollution due to anthropogenic and climatic pressures. Home to millions, the GBM delta is one of the world's most climate-vulnerable regions, facing existential threats from relative sea-level rise and extreme weather. Furthermore, salinity as well as arsenic and other groundwater contaminations drastically reduces freshwater availability of high quality for coastal population and agriculture, a problem projected to worsen due to climate change and increased human pressure.\nThe Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100 (BDP2100) identified the coastal region as one of the hotspots and seeks to ensure sustainable water-system management to mitigate future freshwater scarcity by developing effective techniques and strategies for reducing stress on safe water resources. To support the practical implementation of the BDP2100, the Coast-Water-Solutions project aims to close crucial knowledge gaps on the functioning of the coastal (ground)water system and develop much-needed, science-informed strategies to secure future access to clean freshwater for WASH and food production. The project aims to create an integrated understanding of the (ground)water system. Collaborating with stakeholders, it will co-create site-specific, acceptable technologies and adaptation, mitigation, and management strategies for implementation in Bangladesh.\nYour duties and responsibilities include:\n- Co-develop your PhD research proposal within the framework and deliverables of the Coast-Water-Solutions project;\n- Develop an open hydrogeological database by collecting and managing existing datasets, potentially by including contributions from citizen science.\n- Create a user-friendly modelling framework to analyze the current hydrogeological system in the GBM delta and assess future scenarios related to groundwater availability, salinity and land subsidence impacts.\n- Design and evaluate integrated hydrological solutions to enhance future clean freshwater availability and mitigate water-related threats\n- Actively engage and collaborate within the larger project team (other Bangladesh-based PhDs and project teams) towards the common goals of the project.\n- Travel to Bangladesh to directly collaborate with affiliated project institutes, attend project and programme meetings and to collect data during field campaigns.\n- Publishing your research in peer-reviewed scientific journal papers and presenting your results at conferences",

Home to millions, the GBM delta is one of the world's most climate-vulnerable regions, facing existential threats from relative sea-level rise and extreme weather. Furthermore, salinity as well as arsenic and other groundwater contaminations drastically reduces freshwater availability of high quality for coastal population and agriculture, a problem projected to worsen due to climate change and increased human pressure.<br>The Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100 (BDP2100) identified the coastal region as one of the hotspots and seeks to ensure sustainable water-system management to mitigate future freshwater scarcity by developing effective techniques and strategies for reducing stress on safe water resources. To support the practical implementation of the BDP2100, the Coast-Water-Solutions project aims to close crucial knowledge gaps on the functioning of the coastal (ground)water system and develop much-needed, science-informed strategies to secure future access to clean freshwater for WASH and food production.

Are you challenged by learning and applying cutting-edge molecular biology techniques to address your research questions? Then this job may be for you!\nJoin us!\nThe bacterial pathogen\nXanthomonas campestris\npv.\ncampestris\n(Xcc) causes black rot disease, a significant threat to cabbage crops worldwide. This pathogen enters the vascular system via hydathodes, tiny water pores of leaves that are connected to the xylem vein endings, and spreads systemically. Plants defend themselves against microbial invaders with an immune system involving pattern recognition receptors (PRR) at the cell surface that perceive immune elicitors (also known as MAMPs or DAMPs) activating plant immunity.\nCurrently, we have little understanding of the immune mechanisms in hydathodes and in the vasculature. Are there tissue-specific PRRs that contribute to resistance against Xcc? What are the cognate elicitors that activate PRR signalling? Does the plant detect also non-pathogenic bacteria in the hydathode?\nTasks and responsibilities\nThis project aims to identify immune elicitors (also known as MAMPs or DAMPs) as ligands of PRRs activating plant immunity during Xcc infection in the model plant\nArabidopsis thaliana\n. You will screen for immune-eliciting molecules/proteins using plant immune assays and identify the elicitor by mass spectrometry. The receptor-ligand interaction will be further characterized by applying protein biochemistry methods.

      "description_en": "The Project\nThe project Tracing Evolutionary Pathways in Climate Adaptation in Southeast Asia (TRACE), a European Research Council-funded Advance Grant (ERC Adv) led by Prof. Diana Suhardiman and hosted by the KITLV in Leiden, is looking for four PhD candidates. The project investigates how evolutionary pathways in climate adaptation are created, sustained, and changed over time. Which actors and symbiotic relations connect various place-based knowledge systems and past knowledge (re)production processes with present and future adaptation strategies? Which institutions, local institutional rules, arrangements, and practices serve as cultural and institutional foundations (re)shaping climate adaptation practices over time? Which forces and conditions shape types of agency and political spaces of engagement that are crucial for the creation, sustenance, and reproduction of locally nested inter-scalar adaptive networks?\nWe address these questions by focusing on and collaborating with communities living in four interrelated socio-ecological systems in Southeast Asia. These socio-ecological systems are: 1) upland cultivation in Laos; 2) irrigated agriculture in Indonesia; 3) forest conservation in the Thai-Myanmar borderlands; and 4) sea nomads’ fishing territories in the Philippines. Each of the four PhD candidates will identify and trace evolutionary pathways in climate adaptation of one specific socio-ecological system.\nThe project, consisting of a Principal Investigator and two Postdoc researchers studying grassroots adaptation strategies, is now seeking 4 PhD candidates to join the team. Each PhD researcher will also engage with the respective country researcher team. This research project is led by KITLV in collaboration with various partners in the Global South including national universities and civil society organizations in Laos, Indonesia, Thailand, Myanmar, and the Philippines.\nThe Position: PhD candidate to work on upland cultivation in Laos\nThe 4 PhD candidates will carry out historical and/or ethnographic research to connect grassroots knowledge systems, cultural values, and agency shaping of the past, how they have evolved over time, and how they are translated to present and future adaptation strategies. With Southeast Asia as geographical focus, each PhD candidate will identify key knowledge systems and institutional nodes, and trace evolutionary pathways of local communities’ adaptation strategies, in specific socio-ecological systems. Treating climate adaptation as an integral part of livelihood (re)making, each PhD candidate will look at how processes of knowledge (re)production are embedded in existing power relations and power interplay and contribute to the development of transdisciplinary concepts and grassroots ontological frameworks in climate governance research.\nWhat will you do?\nWithin the research project, you will work on your PhD research. You will address the project’s main research question of how evolutionary pathways of communities adaptation strategies are (re)shaped by the politics of knowledge reproduction, cultural values, and agency shaping. Your project contains a comprehensive literature review and will also involve extensive fieldwork (a total of 1 year) on upland cultivation in Laos. During this time, you will collaborate with country researchers by conducting in-depth semi-structured interviews, documenting oral histories, engaging in participant observation, collecting relevant written and audiovisual material, and/or employing other methods in which you are experienced (as outlined in your research proposal).\nYou will also collaborate within a team context, which includes four PhD candidates, a Principal Investigator, a Postdoctoral Researcher, and a Research Coordinator. This collaboration will involve the co-organization of academic and public events, both in the respective countries where your research take place and regionally as part of the project’s cross-learning process and regional network formation.",

        "description": "<strong>The Project</strong><br><br>The project Tracing Evolutionary Pathways in Climate Adaptation in Southeast Asia (TRACE), a European Research Council-funded Advance Grant (ERC Adv) led by Prof. Diana Suhardiman and hosted by the KITLV in Leiden, is looking for four PhD candidates. The project investigates how evolutionary pathways in climate adaptation are created, sustained, and changed over time. Which actors and symbiotic relations connect various place-based knowledge systems and past knowledge (re)production processes with present and future adaptation strategies? Which institutions, local institutional rules, arrangements, and practices serve as cultural and institutional foundations (re)shaping climate adaptation practices over time? Which forces and conditions shape types of agency and political spaces of engagement that are crucial for the creation, sustenance, and reproduction of locally nested inter-scalar adaptive networks?<br><br>We address these questions by focusing on and collaborating with communities living in four interrelated socio-ecological systems in Southeast Asia. These socio-ecological systems are: 1) upland cultivation in Laos; 2) irrigated agriculture in Indonesia; 3) forest conservation in the Thai-Myanmar borderlands; and 4) sea nomads’ fishing territories in the Philippines. Each of the four PhD candidates will identify and trace evolutionary pathways in climate adaptation of one specific socio-ecological system.<br><br>The project, consisting of a principal investigator and two Postdoc researchers studying grassroots adaptation strategies, is now seeking 4 PhD candidates to join the team. Each PhD candidate will also engage with the respective country researcher team. This research project is led by KITLV in collaboration with various partners in the Global South including national universities and civil society organizations in Laos, Indonesia, Thailand, Myanmar, and the Philippines.<br><br><strong>The Position: PhD candidate to work on forest conservation in the Thai-Myanmar borderlands</strong><br>The 4 PhD candidates will carry out historical and/or ethnographic research to connect grassroots knowledge systems, cultural values, and agency shaping of the past, how they have evolved over time, and how they are translated to present and future adaptation strategies. With Southeast Asia as geographical focus, each PhD candidate will identify key knowledge systems and institutional nodes, and trace evolutionary pathways of local communities’ adaptation strategies, in specific socio-ecological systems. Treating climate adaptation as an integral part of livelihood (re)making, each PhD candidate will look at how processes of knowledge (re)production are embedded in existing power relations and power interplay and contribute to the development of transdisciplinary concepts and grassroots ontological frameworks in climate governance research.<br><br><strong>What will you do? </strong><br>Within the research project, you will work on your PhD research. You will address the project’s main research question of how evolutionary pathways of communities adaptation strategies are (re)shaped by the politics of knowledge reproduction, cultural values, and agency shaping. Your project contains a comprehensive literature review and will also involve extensive fieldwork (a total of 1 year) on forest conservation in the Thai-Myanmar borderlands. During this time, you will collaborate with country researchers by conducting in-depth semi-structured interviews, documenting oral histories, engaging in participant observation, collecting relevant written and audiovisual material, and/or employing other methods in which you are experienced (as outlined in your research proposal).<br><br>You will also collaborate within a team context, which includes four PhD candidates, a Principal Investigator, a Postdoctoral Researcher, and a Research Coordinator.

Alisa van de Haar (university lecturer in historical French literature at Leiden University). Prof. Nadine Akkerman (professor in early modern literature and culture at Leiden University) will be the co-supervisor of the PhD candidate.\nThe project\nThe LangPro project examines the notion of the language sector in early modern North-West Europe: that part of early modern societies and economies which relied primarily on language skills. The early modern period saw a swift increase in occupational opportunities for men and women who possessed language skills such as reading, writing, and text editing in one or more languages. However, since language professionals have never been studied as a separate category in the early modern workforce, the possibilities that existed for linguistically skilled individuals remain a big unknown. LangPro’s central research question is: What professional, financial, and social opportunities did the early modern language sector offer to men and women in the Low Countries, France, the German lands, and England, between 1550 and 1650? Laying the groundwork for a new research domain on the history of the language sector, the project team will develop a prosopographical database that makes it possible to gain insight into the characteristics of professionals in the past whose core business was language and the nature of the sector that employed them.\nPhD position: Women in the Early Modern Language Sector\n- The PhD candidate will conduct a collective analysis of a selection of early modern female language professionals from England, the Low Countries, France, and the German lands to explore to what extent women could benefit from employment in the language industry. Although women (with only a few exceptions) did not have access to academic education, language skills offered them a way to pursue intellectual professions, such as translator or language teacher. For each of these women, The PhD will examine their biographical data, personal writings, and correspondence in order to find patterns in the language skills they professed, the ways in which they found and secured employment, and the financial and social benefits they obtained through their language work. Besides working on this individual research project, the PhD candidate will also collaborate with other team members in the LangPro project to build a database on early modern language professionals.\nKey responsibilities\n- Conducting research on the role of women in the early modern language sector. Part of this research will take place in archives and libraries in the UK, Belgium, Germany, and France;\n- Completing a PhD thesis (in English) within four years;\n- Contributing to the project’s collaborative database;\n- Publishing at least two (co-authored) articles in peer-reviewed journals or volumes;\n- Presenting papers at conferences, both in the Netherlands and internationally;\n- Participating in monthly meetings of the project research group;\n- Participating in the training programme of the LUCAS (Leiden University Centre for the Arts in Society) Institute, the Leiden Graduate School of Humanities, the Huizinga Institute (Netherlands Research School for Cultural History), and other relevant masterclasses, summer schools, seminars, workshops, and events;\n- Participating in the PhD community and the intellectual life of the LUCAS Institute;\n- Subject to progress and demand, some teaching in the second and third years of your PhD project, in line with your expertise and prior experience.\nYour profile\n- You hold a ResMA/MRes or MA with a specialisation in history, early modern studies, literature, or languages;\n- Your ResMA/MA should be awarded by time of appointment, with a grade of 8.0 or above on a ten-point scale (distinction or equivalent) for your thesis. If the MA thesis is not yet finished, we invite you to provide contact details for your supervisor in your application letter so we may consult with them on your progress;\n- You are willing to work up to 2 months in archives and libraries in the UK, Belgium, France, and Germany in year 1 and year 2 of the project, up to a total of 4 months for the duration of the project;\n- You have well-developed research skills, including the ability to formulate creative research questions, descriptive and analytical skills, and a clear and persuasive style of writing;\n- You have an interest in or affinity with the language sector and gender studies;\n- You have experience with or are willing to learn about early modern (hand)writing in Dutch, English, German, and French;\n- You have full professional working proficiency in English (speaking, writing, reading);\n- You have professional working proficiency in German, French and/or Dutch, (especially reading), or a willingness to learn one of these languages. Knowledge of Latin is a bonus;\n- You have proven time-management skills;\n- You are a team player and independent thinker;\n- You have the ability to finish the proposed PhD research in 4 years.\nInternational candidates are encouraged to apply but must be willing to relocate to the Netherlands for the duration of the project.\nThe organisation\nThe Faculty of Humanities at Leiden University is a unique international centre for the advanced study of languages, cultures, arts, and societies worldwide, in their historical contexts from prehistory to the present. Our faculty is home to more than 6,000 students and 800 staff members.

Alisa van de Haar (university lecturer in historical French literature at Leiden University). Prof. Nadine Akkerman (professor in early modern literature and culture at Leiden University) will be the co-supervisor of the PhD candidate.\nThe project\nThe LangPro project examines the notion of the language sector in early modern North-West Europe: that part of early modern societies and economies which relied primarily on language skills. The early modern period saw a swift increase in occupational opportunities for men and women who possessed language skills such as reading, writing, and text editing in one or more languages. However, since language professionals have never been studied as a separate category in the early modern workforce, the possibilities that existed for linguistically skilled individuals remain a big unknown. LangPro’s central research question is: What professional, financial, and social opportunities did the early modern language sector offer to men and women in the Low Countries, France, the German lands, and England, between 1550 and 1650? Laying the groundwork for a new research domain on the history of the language sector, the project team will develop a prosopographical database that makes it possible to gain insight into the characteristics of professionals in the past whose core business was language and the nature of the sector that employed them.\nPhD position: Early Modern Language Associations: Societies and Guilds in the Language Industry\nThis PhD project will examine how language professionals supported each other by uniting in guilds, societies, and associations in early modern North-West Europe. To this end, the PhD candidate will study early modern archives of guilds and associations related to the language industry in the Low Countries, France, Germany, and England, between 1550 and 1650. Studying the organisations that were related to the language sector is imperative for our understanding of the functioning of this professional domain: to what extent and how did guilds in the language sector verify and guarantee the levels of language proficiency of their members? In what types of conflict did guilds in the language sector mediate? What schooling did they offer?\nThis PhD project will yield new insights into the differences between various regions in North-West Europe regarding the forms of institutional support that was available to language professionals, the professions to which these organisations catered (e.g. language teachers, secretaries, etc.), and their functioning. It will thus yield crucial insights into the social functioning of the early modern language sector, as well as into the functioning of the guild system itself. Besides working on this individual research project, the PhD candidate will also collaborate with other team members in the LangPro project to build a database on early modern language professionals.\nKey responsibilities\n- Conducting archival research on early modern guilds related to the language sector in North-West Europe. An important part of this research will take place in archives in the UK, Belgium, Germany, and France;\n- Completing a PhD thesis (in English) within four years;\n- Contributing to the project’s collaborative database;\n- Publishing at least two (co-authored) articles in peer-reviewed journals or volumes;\n- Presenting papers at conferences, both in the Netherlands and internationally;\n- Participating in monthly meetings of the project research group;\n- Participating in the training programme of the LUCAS (Leiden University Centre for the Arts in Society) Institute, the Leiden Graduate School of Humanities, the Huizinga Institute (Netherlands Research School for Cultural History), and other relevant masterclasses, summer schools, seminars, workshops, and events;\n- Participating in the PhD community and the intellectual life of the LUCAS Institute;\n- Subject to progress and demand, some teaching in the second and third years of your PhD project, in line with your expertise and prior experience.\nYour profile\n- You hold a ResMA/MRes or MA with a specialisation in history, early modern studies, or languages;\n- Your ResMA/MA should be awarded by time of appointment, with a grade of 8.0 or above on a ten-point scale (distinction or equivalent) for your thesis.

We will investigate which ones of these chemicals are the problem source and redesign the biological process to avoid process instabilities. New insights into biodegradability and accumulation of surface-active chemicals on microbial biofilms and relations to mass transfer and process stability can be used to rationally design the water treatment in recycled cardboard making or to reassess the types of chemicals that the industry uses.\nYou will focus on elucidating which surface active chemicals (SACs) used in recycled cardboard production or their combinations thereof have the tendency to form viscoelastic films on microbial biofilms. Since the wastewater matrix of papermaking may contain e.g., surfactants and polyelectrolytes at the same time, it is very likely that complexes of these SACs ultimately are interacting with the biofilm surface. Furthermore, they can be attached to colloids in wastewater before reaching the anaerobic treatment.\nHence, a systematic screening of SACs in small scale batch sorption-biodegradation experiments will be combined with continuous expanded granular sludge bed investigations to assess their accumulation potential and impact on process performance under continuous flow. Results of biodegradation kinetics, adsorption behaviour and interfacial behaviour (performed at WUR-FPH) will be exploited to design a continuous process with improved stability, when exposed to SAC containing wastewater streams. Here e.g., hydrodynamic shear effects can be exploited, when response to stresses of these SAC-films at the interface is known. These results will provide essential information for anaerobic process design in recycled cardboard industry under water-saving scenarios.\nThis PhD project comprises the following activities:\n- Sorption kinetics/isotherm investigation of SACs in solution/attached to colloids;\n- Biodegradation kinetics of SACs in solution/attached to colloids;\n- Sorption and biodegradation of SACs in EGSB reactors in relation to process performance;\n- Perform and Analyse Particle Image Velocimetry data in shear controlled continuous experiments;\n- Developing guidelines for controlling negative effects of SACs in anaerobic wastewater treatment.\nThe second PhD position is\nMechanisms of surface-active chemical film formation and their mechanical properties (at FPH – WUR).\nBoth PhDs will be performed in close collaboration with Kemira, Paques B.V., DS Smith Kemsley and Smurfit Westrock Roermond.

      "description_en": "Welkom bij de Universiteit Maastricht!\nWil jij als onderzoeker bijdragen aan betere zorg voor mensen die niet meer beter worden, door meer inzicht en kennis te genereren in samenwerking met (klinische) experts uit het veld? Dan ben jij de onderzoeker die we zoeken!\nPromovendus – MetAddon-studie\n- Ons doel: het verbeteren van de pijnbehandeling bij mensen met kankergerelateerde botpijn.\nOns doel:\n- Jouw collega’s: het Expertisecentrum Palliatieve Zorg bestaat onder andere uit artsen, verpleegkundigen en onderzoekers, die samen werken aan palliatieve zorg.\nJouw collega’s:\nAchtergrond\nBij vele kankersoorten komen uitzaaiingen naar het bot voor, vaak gepaard met ernstige, kankergerelateerde botpijn (KgB). De behandeling van KgB kan bestaan uit bestraling (gouden standaard) en (pijn)medicatie. Bestraling verminderd de pijn bij slecht 60-80% van de patiënten en meer dan 25% van de patiënten met botuitzaaiingen krijgt te weinig pijnmedicatie.\nIn dit KWF-project van het Expertisecentrum Palliatieve Zorg (EPZ) van MUMC+, in samenwerking met 7 andere medische centra in Nederland, onderzoekt of methadon, toegevoegd aan reeds voorgeschreven opioïden, effectiever is dan additief morfine, bij patiënten met ernstige KgB. Hiertoe wordt een dubbelblind gerandomiseerd multicenteronderzoek gedaan. De verwachting is dat methadon als additief een goede alternatieve pijnbehandeling is voor patiënten met KgB waar de bestraling weinig effect heeft, of voor patiënten waarbij nog geen bestraling plaats heeft gevonden, resulterend in een betere kwaliteit van leven.\nWat jij doet\nAls promovendus palliatieve geneeskunde bij EPZ van het MUMC+ begeleid je de door KWF gesubsidieerde studie “Methadone as co-analgesic for patients with metastatic bone pain: a double-blind randomized controlled trial (\nMet\nAddon)”.\n- Je coördineert de uitvoering van de studie in samenwerking met de deelnemende centra en bent het centrale aanspreekpunt\n- Je bent verantwoordelijk voor patiëntinclusie, dataverzameling en voortgangsbewaking\n- Je analyseert de resultaten en werkt aan wetenschappelijke publicaties\n- Je draagt bij aan aanvullende onderzoeksprojecten binnen het thema van de palliatieve zorg\n- Je werkt intensief samen binnen het kernteam van de onderzoekers van EPZ MUMC+ en krijgt daarbij uitstekende begeleiding van je promotor en co-promotoren\nBen jij klaar om koers te zetten voor de komende jaren?

This is a 4-year project; regular conditions for a Dutch PhD apply. The position is part of the network Chair Governance of Complex Urban Transformation that is positioned at the intersection of the Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies and Team Governance and Pluralism. This allows you to benefit from expertise in both groups.\nDescription of the overall project\nCities transform over long time. From the very first settlements in Mesopotamia that we now consider the birthplace of the city to the megapolises of Asia, Africa and Southern-America, the city has transformed time and again in response to social, political, economic and environmental pressures. Cities, by their very nature, don’t ‘do’ anything by themselves. It is the people living in them who shape and transform the social and built fabric of the urban. Cities evolve or transform over time as a result of a multitude of factors that include governance and planning. Governing urban transitions is very much about acting here and now in the face of an uncertain future, and hoping that targeted policy and planning help cities to move into new and better states. Therefore, this project focuses on three questions: (1) Under what combination of conditions do cities transform from one stage to the other? (2) In what ways does governance influence these urban transformations? (3) Under what combination of conditions are attainable futures more likely? Answers to those questions require comparative and longitudinal research. Given the profile of the Chair (see below), the focus will be on cities in the majority world.\nJob description\nThe PhD researcher will design and implement the research independently and under guidance of the promotor and supervisor. This entails the set-up of the research, the selection of methods and theories, data collection and analysis. Given the nature of the question, the researcher is expected to cover multiple cities in multiple countries in the majority world. The longitudinal approach covering multiple decades likely calls for the digital processing of archival, newspaper and policy data. Year 1 will focus on refinement of the research project, selection of fitting theories, and articulation of the data collection and associated methods. Years 2 and 3 will be primarily focused on data collection; with year 4 focused on the finalization of the thesis.

      "description_en": "PhD Development of a Low-Voltage Multi-Beam SEM for High-Throughput Imaging | TU Delft\nJob description\nScanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) plays a central role in today’s nanoscale imaging across both science and industry. Yet, despite its exceptional spatial resolution, the limited throughput of conventional single-beam SEMs continues to restrict their use in large-area and high-volume applications.\nAs a PhD candidate at TU Delft, working in close collaboration with our industrial partner Delmic and academic partner AMOLF, you will develop a proof-of-concept prototype of a low-voltage multi-beam SEM that combines high-throughput imaging with integrated cathodoluminescence (CL) detection enabling large-area imaging of biological samples.\nThis four-year research programme will proceed in three main phases. In the initial phase, you will develop and optimize physical and numerical models describing the electron optics of the complete probe-forming column, including the multi-beam generation unit, imaging lenses, scanning system, and signal detection within a multi-beam framework. For this purpose, you will use commercial simulation software tools such as EOD and GPT, while also developing custom Python-based simulation scripts. TU Delft will support your research with access to the DelftBlue supercomputer for large-scale and intensive modelling. In the second phase, you will work / help our technicians on the design and fabrication of electron-optical components, which depending on the final design, may be realized using MEMS technology, conventional precision machining, or a combination of both. The final phase will focus on testing and validating the performance of the prototype, comparing experimental and simulated results to refine both the design and the underlying models. As part of your role, you will publish your findings in scientific journals, present at leading international conferences, and contribute to the supervision of BSc and MSc students through tutorials, exercises, and laboratory work.\nYou will join the Microscopy Instrumentation and Technique (MInT) group within the Department of Imaging Physics, a multidisciplinary team of researchers specializing in electron and ion optics instrumentation, MEMS technology, signal detection, and computational imaging. We foster a welcoming, collaborative, and supportive environment where knowledge exchange and teamwork are strongly encouraged.\nTogether, we share a drive to conduct fundamental research that leads to next-generation instruments, combining our expertise in physics, electronics, and software technology. You will receive extensive hands-on training and advanced courses in electron optics, MEMS, SEMs, and detection systems, as well as personalized coaching to help you build a strong career in research.\nTU Delft (Delft University of Technology)\nDelft University of Technology is built on strong foundations.

Would you like to push the boundaries of system-level modelling, analysis, design, exploration and synthesis beyond the current state-of-the-art? Or are you curious to learn more about the application of AI for system diagnostics and system evolution? We are offering six PhDs positions across the department of Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Mathematics and Computer Science that focus on solving cutting-edge design automation questions that will drive innovation in the Brainport region and beyond.\nInformation\nThe semiconductor industry is vital to global economic growth and technological progress, powering everything from energy solutions to healthcare innovations. Some parts of the design of these high-tech systems - lithography machines – can be automated. However, current design automation solutions are limited to specific domains or subsystems. Holistic system-level design is a necessary next-step because of the complexity of these systems. This implies going beyond current domain-specific solutions by combining mechanical, electrical, software, data science, and AI-expertise.\nWe are seeking highly-motivated candidates for the six PhD positions advertised here that address the challenge above by pushing the boundaries of 1) system-level co-design of architecture, functionality and performance, and 2) leverage system models to monitor and understand operational behaviour of systems and act upon irregularities. This description will continue with a description of all six positions:\nPhD 1: System architecture exploration\n(supervision by: Theo Hofman and Pascal Etman) [Department of Mechanical Engineering]\nThe research by this position aims to achieve automated computational design synthesis of system topologies. This will result in new and novel system topologies which can be automatically analysed and evaluated based on construction and performance indicators. This will require an insight into how to fully automate the discrete topology design synthesis process across system levels and how to learn component descriptions and how these can be interconnected.\nPhD 2: Scenario-based compositional system-level performance engineering\n(supervision by: Twan Basten, Marc Geilen) [Department of Electrical Engineering]\nThe research planned for this position will explore how to achieve correct behavior and required performance (in terms of throughput, latency), while considering concerns and constraints from various engineering domains by leveraging scenario-based design. This methodology considers systems from a behavioral perspective, clustering behaviors with similar characteristics. The envisioned model-based performance engineering starts from use cases (typical and exceptional) and various system scenarios (different operating modes, failures). This will require the development of suitable domain-specific languages (DSLs) to specify use cases from the perspective of the relevant domains as well as model transformation, analysis, and synthesis algorithms that provide functionally correct system configurations with a guaranteed performance. The research focuses on suitable domain models and the required model transformation, analysis, and synthesis approaches.\nWe require candidates for PhD 2 to have good software engineering and programming skills, good knowledge on modeling cyber-physical systems, and preferably experience with DSL development.\nPhD 3: Timing-aware distributed supervisory controller synthesis\n(supervision by: Michel Reniers and Martijn Goorden) [Department of Mechanical Engineering]\nThe automatic synthesis of supervisory controllers will support the design process of lithography machines. To achieve a computationally tractable automatic synthesis, a deep understanding is required into how the (control) architecture of lithography machines and the types of models can be used to capture their behaviour and requirements. This will enable splitting the problem of synthesizing safe supervisors into smaller synthesis problems, the results of which can be composed into a solution for the original system. This will require an understanding of how existing system decompositions and interface specifications be translated into models suitable for hierarchical/distributed supervisory control synthesis.\nWe require candidates for PhD 3 to have knowledge of discrete-event systems, and knowledge of or interest in learning about formal methods, in particular, the theory of Supervisory Controller Synthesis.\nPhD 4: AI-driven legacy system explanation and refactoring\n(supervision by: Lina Ochoa Venegas, Michel Chaudron, Jacob Krüger - collaboration with: Stef van den Elzen) [Department of Mathematics and Computer Science]\nMaintaining an understanding of complex systems with a vast amount of software requires effective architecture explanation frameworks, visualizations and identification of architectural refactoring opportunities in legacy systems. These elements will support onboarding, enhance team efficiency, reduce reliance on system experts, and accelerate software maintenance and development. This will require an understanding of how a system architecture can be extracted and represented in a language-agnostic way, relying in the capabilities of program analysis,generative AI, and advanced visualisation techniques.\nWe require candidates for PhD 4 to hold both a bachelor’s and a master’s degree in Computer Science, Data Science, Software Engineering, or a closely related field. Prior experience with the application and understanding of generative AI methods and tools, as well as a solid background in software engineering and a strong interest on visualisation techniques, are highly desirable.\nPhD 5: Data mining for diagnostics\n(supervision by: Mykola Pechenizkiy, Songgaojun (Amy) Deng) [Department of Mathematics and Computer Science]\nThis research, in close collaboration with ASML AI Research, is based on the promise of a novel framework that integrates evolving knowledge graphs (KGs) with domain-specific foundation models to enhance diagnostic capabilities. This research will look into how knowledge graphs be designed and generated from a combination of software stack, legacy code, and documentation (V-model steps: requirements, system design, module design, etc) to capture equipment behavior, process steps, and causal failure relations, as well as discrepancies between expected behavior from requirements and actual failures from deployed system. The latter knowledge graphs will then be integrated with foundation models to enhance machine interpretability in complex diagnostic environments.\nPhD 6: Automating health monitoring in semicon equipment\n(supervision by: Nathan van de Wouw, Tom Oomen, Michelle Chong) [Department of Mechanical Engineering]\nThis project aims to devise innovative monitoring technology for high-tech systems to perform (semi) autonomous fault isolation, and predictive monitoring. For high-tech equipment, such as those used in the production of semiconductors, monitoring is a challenge because of the highly complex interconnected systems they are consisting of many components/modules, which are functionally, digitally, and physically connected. To achieve such monitoring technology, an understanding is required of how to support the identification and prediction of rare failures, for which only scarce datasets are available.\nCurrent health monitoring technology is typically designed for either (i) individual system components/modules (which would require removing the component from the system, which is not possible in practice), or (ii) for the system as a whole. The first approach fails to account for the interaction between modules and its effect on the whole system. The second approach makes it challenging to isolate which module may be failing and how to zoom in on the part of the system that is the root cause of the failure. This PhD position will address this challenge by developing hierarchical diagnostic tools for complex dynamical systems.\nWe require candidates for PhD 6 to have a\nstrong background in mathematical control theory\nand a keen interest in hybrid dynamical systems, observer design, learning techniques and optimization.",

By exploiting nanoscale materials and systems, it allows drugs to reach specific cells or tissues while minimizing side effects and improving therapeutic efficacy. Its versatility promises breakthroughs in tackling complex diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disorders, and infections. In the NanoMed NL consortium we will develop nanomedicines involving all Dutch shareholders in the whole process. The consortium combines research on fundamental understanding, with the development of novel therapies for cancer or gene therapies for metabolic disorders while monitoring and improving our interaction with the Dutch society.<br><br>The PhD candidate will work on the development of polypept(o)ide-based nanomedicines to improve the current therapeutic options in cancer therapy. Therefore, the candidate will combine the polymerization of <em>N</em>-carboxyanhydrides and solid phase peptide synthesis to develop precision polymers and functional nanomedicines based on these materials. Afterwards, anticancer drugs will be covalently attached by disease responsive covalent bonds. The Functional systems will be evaluated within the consortium with respect to their therapeutic efficacy and compared against conventional antibody drug conjugates (ADCs).<br><br><strong>What you will do</strong><br><ul> <li>Synthesis of functional amino acids</li> <li>Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis</li> <li>NCA/NNCA polymerization</li> <li>Drug conjugation (prodrug attachment) by biorthogonal chemistry</li> <li>Characterization of drug loaded nanoparticles in buffer and biological fluids</li> <li>Drug release studies</li>\n</ul>\n<br><strong>What you bring</strong><br>The Barz lab is looking for candidates with strong background in Polymer and Organic synthesis.

      "description_en": "This PhD project will develop socially just, context-sensitive adaptation strategies against heat stress in informal settlements, particularly in conflict-sensitive settings.\nJob description\nThe increasing frequency and intensity of heat stress due to climate change pose significant risks to vulnerable populations all over the world. This has led to some scholarship and the ensuing policy development in western countries mostly. The impacts of heat stress in informal settlements particularly for those displaced by conflict, is growing, however, is not well documented. This PhD project aims to explore the conceptualization of justice in enhancing adaptive capacities against heat stress in such environments, particularly in conflict-sensitive settings.\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) defines risk as the potential adverse consequences arising from climate-related hazards and the vulnerability of affected systems. The vulnerability framework comprises three crucial elements: exposure to hazards, sensitivity of systems, and capacity to adapt. Recent IPCC assessments have shifted the understanding of exposure, emphasizing that it is an internal quality impacted by external stressors. This transition reflects the need to acknowledge not just environmental factors but also the socio-economic and cultural contexts that shape vulnerability to heat.\nThis research will employ a multi-disciplinary approach to analyse the barriers and opportunities for adaptive capacity to heat stress, incorporating insights from social justice theories. It will assess how factors like poverty, social inequality, infrastructures (including housing) and community resources influence adaptive capacities. Moreover, the project will investigate how societal tensions interact with heat adaptive actions.\nKey objectives of this project are i) developing an holistic understanding of people’s vulnerability to heat in relation to their geographical, cultural, political and climatic context, ii) assessing the role of factors relating to perception (e.g., knowledge and attitude), gender, household composition, home ownership, education, access to resources, migration status and political context in adaptive capacity and iii) developing socially just heat adaptation strategies, that are context and conflict sensitive.\nThis PhD position is situated at the Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment, Department of Urbanism, section of Environmental Technology and Design. The section of Environmental Technology and Design (ETD) contributes to inter- and transdisciplinary, context-driven, and problem/solution-focused research and education for the sake of a better environment. It involves a collaborative design and engineering approach, with social-and environmental-based methods and techniques as operative instruments, as well as the development and application of advanced urban data science and geospatial information technologies to support this primary aim.

        "description": "<strong><em>This PhD project will develop socially just, context-sensitive adaptation strategies against heat stress in informal settlements, particularly in conflict-sensitive settings. </em></strong><br><br><strong>Job description</strong><br>The increasing frequency and intensity of heat stress due to climate change pose significant risks to vulnerable populations all over the world. This has led to some scholarship and the ensuing policy development in western countries mostly. The impacts of heat stress in informal settlements particularly for those displaced by conflict, is growing, however, is not well documented. This PhD project aims to explore the conceptualization of justice in enhancing adaptive capacities against heat stress in such environments, particularly in conflict-sensitive settings.<br><br>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) defines risk as the potential adverse consequences arising from climate-related hazards and the vulnerability of affected systems. The vulnerability framework comprises three crucial elements: exposure to hazards, sensitivity of systems, and capacity to adapt. Recent IPCC assessments have shifted the understanding of exposure, emphasizing that it is an internal quality impacted by external stressors. This transition reflects the need to acknowledge not just environmental factors but also the socio-economic and cultural contexts that shape vulnerability to heat.<br><br>This research will employ a multi-disciplinary approach to analyse the barriers and opportunities for adaptive capacity to heat stress, incorporating insights from social justice theories. It will assess how factors like poverty, social inequality, infrastructures (including housing) and community resources influence adaptive capacities. Moreover, the project will investigate how societal tensions interact with heat adaptive actions.<br><br>Key objectives of this project are i) developing an holistic understanding of people’s vulnerability to heat in relation to their geographical, cultural, political and climatic context, ii) assessing the role of factors relating to perception (e.g., knowledge and attitude), gender, household composition, home ownership, education, access to resources, migration status and political context in adaptive capacity and iii) developing socially just heat adaptation strategies, that are context and conflict sensitive.<br><br>This PhD position is situated at the Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment, Department of Urbanism, section of Environmental Technology and Design.

        "description": "Cerebral palsy (CP) is the leading cause of physical disability in children but is often diagnosed too late, delaying intervention until after critical neuroplastic windows have passed. Recent guidelines have outlined reliable tools for early CP detection, combining brain MRI, EEG, and clinical assessments such as the General Movement Assessment (GMA) and the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (HINE). However, current predictive models lack integration of these modalities and precision in individualized diagnosis and prognosis.<br><br>As part of the ENSEMBLE Project—a multinational study funded by the Fondation Paralysie Cérébrale—you will help develop a machine learning-based multimodal prediction tool for CP diagnosis and long-term outcomes. This tool will integrate advanced clinical assessments to provide personalized prognoses for motor, cognitive, and behavioral outcomes, enhancing family counseling and early intervention strategies.<br><br>Your responsibilities will include:<br><ul> <li>Developing and validating a machine learning prediction model for CP and related</li> <li>outcomes using neonatal MRI, EEG, GMA, HINE, and clinical data.</li> <li>Coordinating patient inclusion, data collection, and analysis across multiple NICUs in five</li> <li>European countries.</li> <li>Harmonizing protocols across study centers and engaging with families to gather clinical and psychosocial data.</li>\n</ul>",

      "description_en": "The Utrecht Department of Earth Sciences, group ‘Stratigraphy and Paleontology’, is looking for a highly motivated and versatile PhD candidate with a MSc background in Earth Sciences, Environmental sciences, Biology, Climate physics, Oceanography or other appropriate fields.\nYour job\nYou will work on the project called\n“Eemian sea level”\n. In this 4-year fully funded position, you will combine 2 toolsets: generating proxy data reflecting surface ocean changes, and simulations of sea level changes using comprehensive ice sheet models.\nThe sea level in the Eemian was much higher than today, 3 to 6 m or even higher. The high sea levels during the Eemian cannot be explained by a complete melting of the Greenland ice sheet, as large parts of it survived the Eemian stage. This implies that the Antarctic ice sheet was also very vulnerable to melting during this period, but little model studies are done on the Antarctic contribution. The aim of this research project is to further investigate the timing of major sea level changes, and thus the contribution of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets during the Eemian by generating high-resolution proxy records from the Dutch subsurface, including the type locality of the Eemian near the city of Amersfoort. Special emphasis will be on the varying background conditions between the Saalian to Eemian transition (i.e., termination II), when large ice sheets formed the Dutch coastline and the adjacent North Sea, and that of the LGM-Holocene transition (i.e., termination I), when large ice caps lay further north.

        "description": "The Utrecht Department of Earth Sciences, group ‘Stratigraphy and Paleontology’, is looking for a highly motivated and versatile PhD candidate with a MSc background in Earth Sciences, Environmental sciences, Biology, Climate physics, Oceanography or other appropriate fields.<br><br><strong>Your job</strong><br>You will work on the project called <strong>“Eemian sea level”</strong>. In this 4-year fully funded position, you will combine 2 toolsets: generating proxy data reflecting surface ocean changes, and simulations of sea level changes using comprehensive ice sheet models.<br><br>The sea level in the Eemian was much higher than today, 3 to 6 m or even higher. The high sea levels during the Eemian cannot be explained by a complete melting of the Greenland ice sheet, as large parts of it survived the Eemian stage. This implies that the Antarctic ice sheet was also very vulnerable to melting during this period, but little model studies are done on the Antarctic contribution. The aim of this research project is to further investigate the timing of major sea level changes, and thus the contribution of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets during the Eemian by generating high-resolution proxy records from the Dutch subsurface, including the type locality of the Eemian near the city of Amersfoort. Special emphasis will be on the varying background conditions between the Saalian to Eemian transition (i.e., termination II), when large ice sheets formed the Dutch coastline and the adjacent North Sea, and that of the LGM-Holocene transition (i.e., termination I), when large ice caps lay further north.

Join us in shaping how additive manufacturing (AM) can help Dutch industry.\nJob description\nWe are looking for a highly motivated PhD candidate who will contribute to Work Package 3 of the Add-reAM project, a large NWO-funded interdisciplinary programme:\n- Universities: TU Delft, UTwente, TU Eindhoven, Erasmus University Rotterdam, ULeiden, Saxion University of Applied Sciences.\n- Research institutes: M2i, NEN.\n- Municipalities: Terneuzen.\n- Companies and associations: Stichting Repair Cafes, Capgemini, Signify, Ramlab, Allseas, Techniek Nederland, SKF, GKN,MX3D, ProRail, Siemens, Berenschot Group, MKB Twente, UltiMaker, Vanderlande, 3devo, International Institute of Welding, Greenwise Campus, Regional Development Agency Oost NL, InNo Time, Logistics Centre of Excellence of the Royal Netherlands Army, Association FME.\nAdd-reAM aims to foster a sustainable, circular future where waste is minimized, resources are conserved and consumer needs are met without compromising the planet's health.\nWhile WP1 focusses on the next-generation AM, WP2 designs remanufacturing using AM, WP3 looks into regulatory, economic, political, environmental, and social innovations.\nYour research will analyse AM in the Netherlands within geopolitical and socioeconoimc context. The current geopolitical turmoil is increasingly answered with industrial strategies, at EU and NL level, though much is still unclear. A clear ambition is to increase innovation, though after decades of deregulation, no clear industrial strategy, and even the closure of the Ministry of Planning in The Netherlands, a decent understanding, let alone a steering of industry is lacking. Building on earlier research, this PhD project will therefore analyse the structure and dynamics of industrial ecosystems surrounding AM in the Netherlands, examining how firms, institutions, and infrastructures interact to enable—or constrain—the development of a competitive and sustainable AM sector.\nThe PhD is situated within economic geography and spatial planning, and will use a mixed methods approach wherein quantitative data (e.g. socioeconomic and logistical data) will be combined with qualitative data (e.g. policy documents, interviews, expert sessions) to achieve an as complete possible analysis of the status-quo. Subsequently, pro-actively and in co-creation, public and private policy recommendations will be formulated to achieve a successful additive manufacturing in Dutch industry.\nCase-studies will be defined during the project, in close collaboration with the consortium.\nYou will:\n- Build a database model of different socio-economic and material data in order to have a nodal-relational dataset for the relevant industries.\n- Further expand the existing visualisation methodology enabling to combine topographical and topological data, to visualise the actor-networks.\n- Organise interviews and expert sessions to verify and improve the results, in order to eventually produce policy recommendations.\n- Collaborate across disciplines with fellow PhDs in Add-reAM.\n- Present your work in academic publications, policy briefs, conferences and workshops with public and private stakeholders.\nTU Delft (Delft University of Technology)\nDelft University of Technology is built on strong foundations.

As a PhD researcher at TU Delft, you’ll contribute to breakthrough science within “Growth with Green Steel” - a national research consortium driving the Netherlands’ transition to fossil-free iron production.\nJob description\nSteel is one of the most critical engineering materials in modern society, significantly enhancing our quality of life through its versatile applications. However, its large-scale primary production is associated with substantial anthropogenic CO2 emissions, contributing approximately 30% of global industrial CO2 emissions and about 7% of global energy consumption. As a result, the steel industry stands among the largest single contributors to global CO2 emissions and faces an urgent decarbonization challenge.\nA significant portion, ~75-80% of CO2 emissions, in steel production arises during the reduction of iron ore (ironmaking) in blast furnaces using carbon-based reductants such as coke and coal. To achieve meaningful emissions reductions, fossil-free ironmaking processes are essential. Among emerging solutions, hydrogen-based direct reduction (HyDR) has gained prominence as a leading green ironmaking route, offering the potential to eliminate direct CO2 emissions during iron ore reduction.This PhD position is part of\nGrowth with Green Steel\n, an exciting and collaborative research programme within the Dutch National Growth Fund, bringing together leading universities, research institutes, and industry partners to accelerate the transition to sustainable iron and steel production.\nAs a PhD researcher you will:\n- Investigate how gangue elements affect the reduction behaviour of iron ore pellets under various process conditions.\n- Analyse local elemental partitioning and microstructural evolution of iron ore pellets, and correlated this to overall reduction kinetics.\n- Study the carburization behaviour of reduced pellets and its effect on melting performance.\n- Apply a multiscale characterization strategy to link microscopic phenomena to macroscopic process outcomes.\n- This fundamental research will contribute to optimizing the HyDR process and pellet design, thereby accelerating the decarbonization of the steel industry.\nSustainable Metallurgy Laboratory\nYou will be part of the\nSustainable Metallurgy Laboratory\nwithin the\nDepartment of Materials Science and Engineering\nat TU Delft. The lab focuses on the understanding of microstructure formation and evolution in sustainable metal production, processing, and recycling by bridging chemical and physical metallurgy. We develop innovative approaches to produce metals and alloys, optimize material properties, reduce environmental impact, and enhance resource efficiency, driving the transition toward greener metallurgical processes.\nYou will work in a collaborative and international research environment, equipped with state-of-the-art facilities in the MSE department for process metallurgy and microstructure characterization. You will have the opportunity to develop strong experimental and analytical skills while contributing to the development of sustainable metal production and processing technologies.

      "description_en": "Help jij ons kinderen en onschuldige ouders beschermen door een rigid body kinematica simulatiemodel voor forensisch vergelijken van letselscenario’s te ontwikkelen?\nFunctieomschrijving\nAchtergrond:\nElk jaar worden 14-41 per 100.000 kinderen zo gewelddadig geschud dat zij daardoor korte en lange termijn fysieke en cognitieve beperkingen en verwondingen oplopen of zelfs overlijden. Forensisch onderzoek moet uitwijzen wat er is gebeurd: is het kindje geschud of geslagen, of misschien per ongeluk gevallen? Er is echter nog veel onbekend over, bijv., bij welke krachten letsel bij deze kinderen optreedt. Hierdoor zijn er ook nog geen goede forensische tools om objectief van verschillende scenario’s te testen welke tot letsel kunnen leiden.\nProject OpenTwin:\nDe Forensic BioMechanical Engineering groep heeft van NWO een subsidie gekregen om OpenTwin te ontwikkelen. OpenTwin zal bestaan uit twee nauw met elkaar samenhangende delen:\n- SENSA, een aanpasbare, antropomorfische schudpop vol sensoren, en waarmee scenario’s kunnen worden nagebootst terwijl de kinematica wordt gemeten.\nSENSA, een aanpasbare, antropomorfische schudpop vol sensoren, en waarmee scenario’s kunnen worden nagebootst terwijl de kinematica wordt gemeten.\n- SIMSON, simulatiesoftware voor het voorspellen en vergelijken van kinematica voor verschillende letselscenario’s.\nMet SENSA zal kinematische data worden verzameld door verdachten, getuigen of onderzoekers scenario’s te laten nabootsen waarvan wordt geclaimd of vermoed dat ze tot het letsel hebben geleid. SIMSON gebruikt vervolgens SENSA's output om een breed bereik aan variaties van het gesimuleerde scenario te simuleren. Het is de bedoeling dat OpenTwin als output objectieve, transparante en makkelijk te interpreteren forensische rapporten levert over de biomechanische waarschijnlijkheid van verschillende scenario’s als oorzaak van letsel dat bij een kindje is gevonden.\nOpenTwin wordt een open platform, met daarin SENSA als open hardware als SIMSON als open software, ontwikkeld met gebruikers en partners in de strafrechtketen die belang hebben bij deze nieuwe forensische tool. Ontwerpeisen zijn o.a. dat het systeem modulair, betaalbaar, makkelijk te maken en intuïtief in gebruik is. Zo zal OpenTwin bijdragen aan veiligheid en gerechtigheid voor iedereen en eindelijk uitkomst bieden in de veel in rechtszalen gevoerde discussie of schudden tot letsel bij jonge kinderen kan leiden. Hiermee helpen wij, en dan ook jij, voorkomen dat schuldige daders ongestraft blijven en kinderen (opnieuw) kunnen mishandelen, maar ook dat onschuldige ouders hun kindje kwijtraken. En vooral beschermen we daarmee de kinderen; zowel tegen het terug geplaats worden bij daders als tegen het weggehaald worden bij onschuldige ouders.\nOnderzoeksteam & werkomgeving:\n- Je werkt nauw samen met de andere PhD ( zie onze andere vacature ), want jullie systemen moeten naadloos in elkaar passen.\nzie onze andere vacature\n- Jullie hebben een OpenSim technicus, onze werkplaats en onze ervaren constructeurs en adviseurs tot je beschikking.\n- Jullie worden in dit door NWO gefinancierde project ondersteund door onze internationale gebruikerscommissie met experts uit de hele strafrechtketen tot jullie beschikking (Politie, NFI, OM, rechters, forensisch artsen en biomechanici). Je rolt dus middenin een krachtig netwerk.\n- Jullie promotorenteam bestaat uit experts uit zowel de klinische als de technische hoek.\n- Er is budget voor (productie van) testopstellingen en voor onderdelen voor SENSA, alsook voor trainingen, congressen en enkele korte werkbezoeken in het buitenland.\n- Je komt te werken in de onderzoeksgroep Forensic BioMechanical Engineering ( www.forensicbmeche.nl ).\nwww.forensicbmeche.nl\n- Je krijgt je eigen plek in een lab vol hardwerkende, maar gezellige collega's die elkaar ook veel buiten het werk vinden voor gezelligheid en activiteiten, maar net zo goed alle ruimte geven aan collega's die buiten werktijd hun tijd nodig hebben voor zichzelf, hun eigen sociale kringen of gezin.\nFunctie-eisen\nJouw taken zijn o.a.:\n- Samen met gebruikers en collega’s een PvE en architectuur opstellen voor OpenTwin, SENSA en SIMSON.\n- Ontwerpen en testen van SIMSON: o.a. interfaces en modules voor data-import, rigid-body model schalen op basis van slachtoffergegevens, simuleren van (variaties op) schudden en alternatieve scenario’s, geautomatiseerde rapporten met goed door gebruikers te interpreteren weergave van kinematica, waarschijnlijkheden van causale verbanden met waargenomen letsel etc.\n- Testopstellingen ontwikkelen (samen met de andere PhD en werkplaatssupport) voor gestandaardiseerd verifiëren en valideren van SIMSON en OpenTwin en deze tests uitvoeren.\n- Dat alles als open hardware en open software met goede documentatie.\n- Uiteraard hoort bij een promotieplek ook dat je wetenschappelijke vaardigheden en een goed netwerk ontwikkelt, je onderzoeksresultaten publiceert in wetenschappelijke journals, helpt bij het begeleiden van afstudeerders (op jouw project) en af en toe ondersteunt bij onderwijs als er taken liggen die bij jou passen.\nFunctie-eisen:\n- Afgeronde universitaire Master in een relevant gebied, zoals werktuigbouwkunde, elektrotechniek, biomedical engineering, bewegingstechnologie, technical medicine, etc.\n- Ervaring met het uitvoeren van bewegingsstudies met gebruik van bijvoorbeeld IMU’s en/of optische motion capture.\n- Ervaring met het opzetten en doen van bewegingssimulaties o.b.v. rigid body modellen. Ervaring met OpenSim is een pré.\n- Ervaring met het ontwikkelen van sofware (liefst in C++, Python, MATLAB), het doen van gebruikstesten en het werken met Git repositories.\n- Interesse in biomechanica en het forensisch veld.\n- Vaardig met meetsystemen voor kinematica, bewegingsanalyses etc.\n- In staat om samen te werken in een zeer interdisciplinair team, initiatief te nemen en resultaatgericht te werken.\n- Goede communicatieve vaardigheden met oog voor de forensische en maatschappelijke context, gevoeligheden en nuances die bij dit onderwerp horen.\n- Uitstekende mondelinge en schriftelijke beheersing van de Engelse en Nederlandse taal.\nTU Delft\nDe Technische Universiteit Delft heeft een sterk fundament.

      "description_en": "Help jij ons kinderen en onschuldige ouders beschermen door een testpop vol forensische technologie te ontwikkelen?\nFunctieomschrijving\nAchtergrond:\nElk jaar worden 14-41 per 100.000 kinderen zo gewelddadig geschud dat zij daardoor korte en lange termijn fysieke en cognitieve beperkingen en verwondingen oplopen of zelfs overlijden. Forensisch onderzoek moet uitwijzen wat er is gebeurd: is het kindje geschud of geslagen, of misschien per ongeluk gevallen? Er is echter nog veel onbekend over, bijv., bij welke krachten letsel bij deze kinderen optreedt. Hierdoor zijn er ook nog geen goede forensische tools om objectief van verschillende scenario’s te testen welke tot letsel kunnen leiden.\nProject OpenTwin:\nDe Forensic BioMechanical Engineering groep heeft van NWO een subsidie gekregen om OpenTwin te ontwikkelen. OpenTwin zal bestaan uit twee nauw met elkaar samenhangende delen:\n- SENSA, een aanpasbare, antropomorfische schudpop vol sensoren, en waarmee scenario’s kunnen worden nagebootst terwijl de kinematica wordt gemeten.\n- SIMSON, simulatiesoftware voor het voorspellen en vergelijken van kinematica voor verschillende letselscenario’s.\nSIMSON, simulatiesoftware voor het voorspellen en vergelijken van kinematica voor verschillende letselscenario’s.\nMet SENSA zal kinematische data worden verzameld door verdachten, getuigen of onderzoekers scenario’s te laten nabootsen waarvan wordt geclaimd of vermoed dat ze tot het letsel hebben geleid. SIMSON gebruikt vervolgens SENSA's output om een breed bereik aan variaties van het gesimuleerde scenario te simuleren. Het is de bedoeling dat OpenTwin als output objectieve, transparante en makkelijk te interpreteren forensische rapporten levert over de biomechanische waarschijnlijkheid van verschillende scenario’s als oorzaak van letsel dat bij een kindje is gevonden.\nOpenTwin wordt een open platform, met daarin SENSA als open hardware als SIMSON als open software, ontwikkeld met gebruikers en partners in de strafrechtketen die belang hebben bij deze nieuwe forensische tool. Ontwerpeisen zijn o.a. dat het systeem modulair, betaalbaar, makkelijk te maken en intuïtief in gebruik is. Zo zal OpenTwin bijdragen aan veiligheid en gerechtigheid voor iedereen en eindelijk uitkomst bieden in de veel in rechtszalen gevoerde discussie of schudden tot letsel bij jonge kinderen kan leiden. Hiermee helpen wij, en dan ook jij, voorkomen dat schuldige daders ongestraft blijven en kinderen (opnieuw) kunnen mishandelen, maar ook dat onschuldige ouders hun kindje kwijtraken. En vooral beschermen we daarmee de kinderen; zowel tegen het terug geplaats worden bij daders als tegen het weggehaald worden bij onschuldige ouders.\nOnderzoeksteam & werkomgeving:\n- Je werkt nauw samen met de andere PhD ( zie onze andere vacature ), want jullie systemen moeten naadloos in elkaar passen.\nzie onze andere vacature\n- Jullie hebben een OpenSim technicus, onze werkplaats en onze ervaren constructeurs en adviseurs tot je beschikking.\n- Jullie worden in dit door NWO gefinancierde project ondersteund door onze internationale gebruikerscommissie met experts uit de hele strafrechtketen tot jullie beschikking (Politie, NFI, OM, rechters, forensisch artsen en biomechanici). Je rolt dus middenin een krachtig netwerk.\n- Jullie promotorenteam bestaat uit experts uit zowel de klinische als de technische hoek.\n- Er is budget voor (productie van) testopstellingen en voor onderdelen voor SENSA, alsook voor trainingen, congressen en enkele korte werkbezoeken in het buitenland.\n- Je komt te werken in de onderzoeksgroep Forensic BioMechanical Engineering ( www.forensicbmeche.nl ).\nwww.forensicbmeche.nl\n- Je krijgt je eigen plek in een lab vol hardwerkende, maar gezellige collega's die elkaar ook veel buiten het werk vinden voor gezelligheid en activiteiten, maar net zo goed alle ruimte geven aan collega's die buiten werktijd hun tijd nodig hebben voor zichzelf, hun eigen sociale kringen of gezin.\nFunctie-eisen\nJouw taken zijn o.a.:\n- Samen met gebruikers en collega’s een programma van eisen en architectuur opstellen voor OpenTwin, SENSA en SIMSON.\n- Ontwerpen en testen van SENSA: o.a. modulaire basismodule met sensoren, gewrichten, nek, extremiteiten. Zowel elektronica als mechanica. Voor het meten van kinematica en mogelijk ook oogdruk, bloeddruk, breinverplaatsing, bij voorkeur zonder enige vorm van, en anders een zo eenvoudig mogelijke variant van, optische motion capture.\n- Testopstellingen ontwikkelen voor gestandaardiseerd verifiëren en valideren van SENSA en OpenTwin en deze tests uitvoeren.\n- Dat alles als open hardware en open software met goede documentatie.\n- Uiteraard hoort bij een promotieplek ook dat je wetenschappelijke vaardigheden en een goed netwerk ontwikkelt, je onderzoeksresultaten publiceert in wetenschappelijke journals, helpt bij het begeleiden van afstudeerders (op jouw project) en af en toe ondersteunt bij onderwijs als er taken liggen die bij jou passen.\nFunctie-eisen:\n- Afgeronde universitaire Master in een relevant gebied, zoals werktuigbouwkunde, elektrotechniek, biomedical engineering, technical medicine, etc.\n- Ervaring met het systematisch ontwerpen van mechanica en meetelektronica.\n- Ervaring met het maken en assembleren van dergelijke systemen.\n- Ervaring met programmeren in MATLAB en/of Python.\n- Interesse in biomechanica en het forensisch veld.\n- Vaardig met meetsystemen voor kinematica, bewegingsanalyses etc.\n- Bekend met wetenschappelijke methoden voor het ontwerpen en testen van mechanische systemen en bij voorkeur ook met het gebruik van Git repositories.\n- In staat om samen te werken in een zeer interdisciplinair team, initiatief te nemen en resultaatgericht te werken.\n- Goede communicatieve vaardigheden met oog voor de forensische en maatschappelijke context, gevoeligheden en nuances die bij dit onderwerp horen.\n- Uitstekende mondelinge en schriftelijke beheersing van de Engelse en Nederlandse taal.\nTU Delft\nDe Technische Universiteit Delft heeft een sterk fundament.

En zou je graag willen promoveren op een plek waar actuele zorgvraagstukken, wetenschappelijk onderzoek en een internationaal kennisnetwerk samenkomen? Bij de vakgroep Healthcare Governance (HCG) van Erasmus School of Health Policy & Management (ESHPM) zijn wij op zoek naar een gemotiveerde en enthousiaste promovendus die etnografisch onderzoek wil doen naar de rol van technologische ondersteuning in het bevorderen van samenredzaamheid in de zorg voor ouderen.\nProjectbeschrijving\nDe Nederlandse gezondheidszorg staat voor grote uitdagingen door de snel vergrijzende bevolking. Deze demografische verschuiving zorgt voor een toenemende zorgvraag en druk op professionele zorgverlening. Om de druk op deze formele zorg te verlichten, pleit de Nederlandse overheid voor een maatschappelijke transitie van ‘ouderenzorg’ naar ‘zorg voor ouderen’. Hierin worden ouderen gestimuleerd om zo lang mogelijk thuis te wonen en zorg in hun eigen omgeving te ontvangen, ondersteund door een actievere rol voor mantelzorgers. Hoewel de noodzaak van deze transitie door veel partijen wordt erkend, brengt deze ook grote uitdagingen met zich mee. Veel mantelzorgers staan namelijk nu al voor enorme lasten, vaak in combinatie met werk en andere verplichtingen.\nIn hun zoektocht naar oplossingen brengen politici, beleidsmakers en zorgorganisaties twee verschillende richtingen naar voren. De eerste richting is het versterken van\nsamenredzaamheid\n. Het centrale idee achter samenredzaamheid is het faciliteren van thuis wonen door middel van nieuwe zorgnetwerken, waarin zorgverlening als een collectieve inspanning wordt gezien, die is gebaseerd op ondersteuning binnen gemeenschappen. De tweede richting is\ntechnologische innovatie\nals middel om zelfredzaamheid te bevorderen. Technologie en digitalisering worden gezien als cruciale instrumenten om de ouderenzorg duurzaam te houden, taken te automatiseren die traditioneel door formele zorgverleners worden uitgevoerd en ziekenhuisbezoeken te verminderen.\nHoewel samenredzaamheid en technologische innovatie beide gericht zijn op het aanpakken van dezelfde crisis, worden ze grotendeels los van elkaar nagestreefd. In de ontwikkeling van technologie is vaak weinig oog voor de rol van (informele) zorggemeenschappen, terwijl beleids- en buurtinitiatieven op het terrein van samenredzaamheid vaak weinig aandacht hebben voor de manieren waarop technologie dit soort initiatieven zou kunnen ondersteunen. Een belangrijke reden hiervoor is dat deze twee oplossingsrichtingen worden gevormd door verschillende onderliggende\nwaarden\n. Zo richt veel technologie zich op efficiëntie en optimalisatie van processen, terwijl initiatieven op het terrein van samenredzaamheid juist relationele verbondenheid hoog in het vaandel hebben staan. Het gevolg is dat veel technologische innovaties op weerstand stuiten, beperkte acceptatie en aanhoudende uitdagingen in de zorgverlening, terwijl initiatieven gericht op samenredzaamheid technologische oplossingen niet benutten.\nWat ga je doen?\nDe vraag die centraal staat in dit onderzoek, is: Hoe ontwikkelen zorgpraktijken waarbij samenredzaamheid en technologie worden geïntegreerd zich in de praktijk van zorg voor ouderen, welke waardenconflicten ontstaan er en hoe kunnen deze worden aangepakt?\nAls promovendus voer je drie etnografische casestudies uit naar zorgtechnologieën die gericht zijn op het bevorderen van samenredzaamheid. Je brengt in kaart hoe technologieën die samenredzaamheid proberen te bevorderen tegelijkertijd die zorgpraktijken en de waarden die daarin worden gearticuleerd, veranderen. Conceptueel vertrekpunt is een empirische benadering, waarin waarden niet als abstracte entiteiten worden gezien, maar waarin juist concrete en praktische waarderingspraktijken centraal staan. Daarbij bouw je voort op werk in de empirische filosofie en -ethiek, waarderingsstudies en pragmatische sociologie, waarin centraal staat hoe waarden in de praktijk worden geïnterpreteerd, toegepast, onderhandeld en veranderen door de tijd heen (techno-moral change).\nIn onderling overleg worden drie cases voor zorgtechnologieën geselecteerd. Dat doen we in samenwerking met diverse partners in het CARE VISiON consortium (zie hieronder), zoals bestaande informele zorgnetwerken, gemeenten, technologieontwikkelaars en zorgkoepels. Je voert observaties uit van zorgpraktijken om rijke etnografische gegevens te verzamelen over de microdynamiek van zorgverlening. Daarnaast voer je diepgaande, semi-gestructureerde interviews uit met ouderen, informele en formele zorgverleners en technologieontwikkelaars, waarbij je thema's onderzoekt die uit het etnografische veldwerk naar voren komen en reflecteert op de centrale waardendynamiek. Je schrijft uitgebreide beschrijvingen van drie casestudies over zorgtechnologieën die gericht zijn op het verbeteren van samenredzaamheid, met de nadruk op hoe ze waarden en zorgpraktijken voor ouderen veranderen. Door conflicterende waarden en mogelijkheden tot harmonisatie te identificeren en deze te bundelen in tastbare vignetten, begeleid je stakeholders bij het verkennen van hoe technologie kan bijdragen aan het bevorderen van samenredzaamheid.\nJe werkt mee aan het door NWO gefinancierde project\nCARE VISiON (Collaborative Approaches to Reimagining Elder Care: Values-driven Innovations in Samenredzaamheid for Older adults in the Netherlands)\nen maakt deel uit van een geïntegreerd team bestaande uit vier promovendi en twee postdocs.

Vervolgens zal de definitieve interventie in een internationale stepped-wedge RCT worden vergeleken met reguliere zorg op o.a. het eindpunt ziekenhuisopnames, waarbij wij als Utrechtse onderzoeksgroep ‘in the lead’ zijn en de promovendus een kartrekkersrol zal vervullen.<br><br>Het tweede project is het GUARD-HF project (GENERAL PRACTICE OUT-OF-HOURS ASSESSMENT AND PREDICTION OF HOSPITALIZATION IN ELDERLY PATIENTS WITH HEART FAILURE), een tweejarige observationele studie waarbij zal worden onderzocht wat er gebeurt met oudere patiënten met hartfalen voor, tijdens en na een contact met de huisartsenpost (HAP), en of er voorspellers voor ziekenhuisopname na een HAP-contact te identificeren zijn. Hiertoe zullen verschillende databronnen (van huisartsenposten, huisartsenpraktijken en ziekenhuizen) aan elkaar worden gekoppeld. Je zult hierbij routinezorg huisartsendata gaan verzamelen, analyseren en interpreteren.<br><br>Je wordt onderdeel van het hechte, ambitieuze en enthousiaste HAG-HVZ team van de afdeling HAG&amp;VW, bestaande uit academische huisartsen, AIOTO’s/promovendi en andere onderzoekmedewerkers die impactvol onderzoek doen naar diverse hart- en vaatziekten in de eerstelijn. Je krijgt de kans om samen te werken met nationale en internationale onderzoekers en daarbij communicatieve, analytische en epidemiologische kwaliteiten verder te ontwikkelen. Leren en delen van opgedane kennis is onderdeel van de functie.<br><br>Werkdagen zijn van maandag t/m vrijdag, waarbij het gewenst is om in ieder geval de donderdagen op het Julius Centrum aanwezig te zijn. Het UMC Utrecht heeft een hybride werkomgeving waarin gedeeltelijk thuiswerken mogelijk is.",

Are you curious how to combine and explore the synergy between Visualization and Process Mining? In this project we aim to transform the way we analyze and visualize complex processes.\nInformation\nThe field of process mining, a branch of business process management, revolves around discovering, analyzing, and optimizing business processes. It does so by extracting insights from event logs, structured records that capture sequences of activities, such as steps in a loan approval workflow, product purchases by customers, or patient journeys across hospitals. However, traditional process mining techniques focus primarily on control-flow, which describes the chain of activities. This singular focus often neglects other dimensions of processes, such as the time between activities and the time required for specific steps, the spatial distribution of tasks across locations, or the intricate relationships between resources and attributes involved in the processes. For example, in a supply chain scenario, understanding delays, warehouse locations, and inventory attributes is crucial, but often omitted in basic control-flow analysis. Process mining, as it stands today, is primarily based on computational techniques and algorithms to analyze and optimize processes. Methods such as process discovery, conformance checking, and performance analysis rely on algorithmic approaches to extract patterns, detect deviations, and identify inefficiencies from event logs. Although these techniques have proven effective in providing data-driven insights, they often fail to use visualization as a powerful means of interpretation and communication. Most process mining tools provide static and linear representations, such as process models (DFGs, BPMN) or Gantt charts, which are primarily suited for experts familiar with these abstractions. This limited use of visualization overlooks the potential for dynamic, interactive visual tools that can make complex process data accessible to a broader audience, enabling intuitive exploration and deeper understanding of multi-faceted process attributes, such as time, resources, and contextual dependencies and correlations.\nIn contrast, the field of visual analytics focuses on developing tools and techniques to support the interpretation of complex, multi-dimensional data. It provides concepts and techniques to explore and analyze event sequences, allowing patterns and anomalies to emerge intuitively. For example, visualizations such as timelines, Sankey diagrams, or network diagrams make it possible to uncover dependencies and bottlenecks in event sequences. Despite their shared goal of deriving actionable insights from event sequence data, process mining and visual analytics have largely operated in parallel, leaving significant opportunities for synergy unexplored.\nBy integrating the two domains, process mining can benefit from visual analytics’ expertise in handling multi-faceted data. Visualizations that incorporate temporal, spatial, and relational aspects can unlock deeper insights into processes. Conversely, visual analytics can leverage process mining techniques to enhance guidance and evaluation during data exploration. For instance, capturing event logs while users interact with visualization tools can provide valuable feedback to refine analytical techniques.\nThe challenge lies in merging these disciplines effectively, combining their strengths to fully realize the potential of multi-faceted data for visual process analytics. This project tackles this open problem, aiming to create a unified framework that harmonizes these complementary fields, transforming the way we analyze and visualize complex processes.\nIn this project, the focus is on developing Visual Analytics techniques for event sequence exploration and analysis to enable Multi-Faceted Visual Process Analytics. The project is performed within the Visualization cluster under the supervision of dr.ir. Stef van den Elzen and dr. Fernando Paulovich.\nThe visualization cluster (\nhttps://research.tue.nl/en/organisations/visualization-3\n) at TU/e has a strong track record in visualization and visual analytics for high-dimensional data.

One solution to this problem is the use of non-toxic, biodegradable electronics. Make a difference by joining a world-leading research group working on the cutting-edge transport studies using biological nanowires. In a recent breakthrough experiment, we discovered that certain bacteria (cable bacteria) can conduct electricity over centimetre distances at conductivity levels surpassing that of many doped, man-made organic semiconductors. As a PhD student in Quantum Nanoscience at the vanderZant lab, you will be fabricating electronic circuits with bio-nanowires, measure their electronic properties and explore quantum transport phenomena in them.\nYou will conduct research on how biological nanowires conduct electricity and how this can be exploited for functional device components on the nanoscale. Depending on your interests in quantum transport phenomena, your research may be dedicated to the study of bio-transport in the mesoscopic regime. You will be responsible for the fabrication of devices in the state-of-the-art cleanroom at our Kavli Nanolaboratory. In addition, you will measure the transport properties at varying temperatures, gate and magnetic fields. A crucial aspect lies in the interpretation/modelling of the results. In this role, you will get to work with a variety of devices structures, with an emphasis on quantifying the transport mechanism. You’ll also be looking for signatures of quantum effects, especially at low temperatures where transport may involve phase coherent phenomena and quantum nuclear tunnelling.\nYou will join a diverse and driven team of academic staff, PhD students and postdocs in Delft. Fostering an inspiring, friendly and supportive environment, we meet regularly to share ideas and knowledge or socialize. In addition, you will receive all the training you need to evolve as a scientist in this fast-developing field. You’ll closely collaborate with biologists (including PhD students) in Belgium, who provide the cable bacteria.\nTU Delft (Delft University of Technology)\nDelft University of Technology is built on strong foundations. As creators of the world-famous Dutch waterworks and pioneers in biotech, TU Delft is a top international university combining science, engineering and design. It delivers world class results in education, research and innovation to address challenges in the areas of energy, climate, mobility, health and digital society. For generations, our engineers have proven to be entrepreneurial problem-solvers, both in business and in a social context.\nAt TU Delft we embrace diversity as one of our core\nvalues\nand we actively\nengage\nto be a university where you feel at home and can flourish. We value different perspectives and qualities. We believe this makes our work more innovative, the TU Delft community more vibrant and the world more just. Together, we imagine, invent and create solutions using technology to have a positive impact on a global scale. That is why we invite you to apply. Your application will receive fair consideration.\nChallenge. Change.

One solution to this problem is the use of non-toxic, biodegradable electronics. Make a difference by joining a world-leading research group working on the cutting-edge transport studies using biological nanowires. In a recent breakthrough experiment, we discovered that certain bacteria (cable bacteria) can conduct electricity over centimetre distances at conductivity levels surpassing that of many doped, man-made organic semiconductors. As a PhD student in Quantum Nanoscience at the vanderZant lab, you will be fabricating electronic circuits with bio-nanowires, measure their electronic properties and explore quantum transport phenomena in them.<br><br>You will conduct research on how biological nanowires conduct electricity and how this can be exploited for functional device components on the nanoscale. Depending on your interests in quantum transport phenomena, your research may be dedicated to the study of bio-transport in the mesoscopic regime. You will be responsible for the fabrication of devices in the state-of-the-art cleanroom at our Kavli Nanolaboratory. In addition, you will measure the transport properties at varying temperatures, gate and magnetic fields. A crucial aspect lies in the interpretation/modelling of the results. In this role, you will get to work with a variety of devices structures, with an emphasis on quantifying the transport mechanism. You’ll also be looking for signatures of quantum effects, especially at low temperatures where transport may involve phase coherent phenomena and quantum nuclear tunnelling.<br><br>You will join a diverse and driven team of academic staff, PhD students and postdocs in Delft. Fostering an inspiring, friendly and supportive environment, we meet regularly to share ideas and knowledge or socialize. In addition, you will receive all the training you need to evolve as a scientist in this fast-developing field.

At Maastricht University, your work makes a real difference – whether you’re exploring the future through research, inspiring students in the classroom, or helping to shape everything that makes our education and research possible.\nPhD Candidate in Soil Microbial Ecology and Greenhouse Gas Fluxes\n- Our goal: Understand how soil nutrients and labile carbon control microbial processes that regulate greenhouse gas emissions.\nOur goal:\n- Your colleagues: A collaborative team of ecologists and environmental scientists within the Department of System Earth Science at the Faculty of Science and Engineering (FSE), working to better understand Earth’s systems and their role in a changing climate.\nYour colleagues:\nAbout the position\nSoils are key players in the global greenhouse gas balance through the metabolic activity of their microbial communities. Nutrient inputs and labile carbon availability shape these microbial processes, influencing the fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO₂), nitrous oxide (N₂O), and methane (CH₄) between soil and atmosphere.\nIn this PhD project, you will investigate how nutrient and labile carbon supply regulate soil microbial activity, greenhouse gas fluxes, and volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions. You will combine greenhouse gas flux measurements, soil volatilome profiling, and microbiome analyses to uncover the mechanisms driving microbial control of soil–atmosphere interactions.\nYour work will include manipulative field and greenhouse experiments, laboratory analyses, and international collaboration. The project builds on recent findings from boreal forest ecosystems and contributes to a better understanding of the microbial feedbacks that shape our planet’s climate.\nYou will be supervised by Prof. Martin Bader, Prof. Paolina Garbeva, and Assist. Prof. Kevin Van Sundert and work in collaboration with Linnaeus University (Sweden) and the University of Parma (Italy).\nIn this role, you will:\n- Design and conduct field, greenhouse, and laboratory experiments.\n- Measure greenhouse gas fluxes and profile soil volatiles.\n- Analyse soil microbiome composition and function.\n- Integrate biogeochemical, microbial, and environmental data.\n- Present your work at international conferences and publish in peer-reviewed journals.\n- Contribute to teaching and community activities within the department.\nAre you ready to help unravel the microbial processes that shape Earth’s climate? Then we’d love to meet you.\nWhat you bring\nIt’s not about ticking boxes – it’s about your curiosity, motivation, and scientific drive. Do you recognise yourself in this?\n- Scientifically curious. You hold (or are about to complete) a Master’s degree in Ecology, Soil Science, Environmental Science, Geography, Forestry, Agricultural Science, or a related discipline.\n- Hands-on researcher.

      "description_en": "CAR T-celtherapie is een revolutionaire behandeling voor patiënten met hematologische maligniteiten. Er zijn sterke aanwijzingen dat deze therapie ook bij auto-immuunziekten zeer effectief is en zelfs genezend kan werken.\nAuto-immuunziekten zijn meestal niet te genezen en vaak spelen antilichaam-producerende B-cellen een belangrijke rol. CAR T-celtherapie is een krachtige, nieuwe en veelbelovende behandeling die in staat is de B-cellen tijdelijk uit het lichaam te verwijderen. De eerste onderzoeken bij patiënten met auto-immuunziekten laten zien dat de behandeling zeer effectief kan zijn, omdat het afweersysteem een soort ‘reset’ krijgt. Bij veel patiënten herstelt daarna de balans in het afweersysteem en stopt het ziekteproces.\nIn het CAR-TB-CURE-project gaan wij onderzoeken of \"in-house\" geproduceerde CAR T-cellen een veilige en (kosten)effectieve behandeling zijn voor patiënten met auto-immuunziekten, vergeleken met de huidige standaardbehandeling. Ook onderzoeken we met geavanceerde laboratoriumtechnieken de werking van CAR T-cellen bij patiënten. Het project richt zich op de ziektebeelden myositis, myasthenia gravis, systemische lupus erythematodes en systemische sclerose.\nWil je alvast meer weten over de verschillende fases binnen het PhD-traject? Op\ndeze pagina\nlees je hierover meer informatie.\nAls arts-onderzoeker speel je een rol in het opzetten van de studie, het includeren van de patiënten en het verzamelen van patiëntgegevens in Amsterdam UMC. Binnen het project zul je nauw samenwerken met collega’s van de afdelingen Neurologie, Reumatologie en Hematologie.

Er zijn sterke aanwijzingen dat deze therapie ook bij auto-immuunziekten zeer effectief is en zelfs genezend kan werken.<br><br>Auto-immuunziekten zijn meestal niet te genezen en vaak spelen antilichaam-producerende B-cellen een belangrijke rol. CAR T-celtherapie is een krachtige, nieuwe en veelbelovende behandeling die in staat is de B-cellen tijdelijk uit het lichaam te verwijderen. De eerste onderzoeken bij patiënten met auto-immuunziekten laten zien dat de behandeling zeer effectief kan zijn, omdat het afweersysteem een soort ‘reset’ krijgt. Bij veel patiënten herstelt daarna de balans in het afweersysteem en stopt het ziekteproces.<br><br>In het CAR-TB-CURE-project gaan wij onderzoeken of \"in-house\" geproduceerde CAR T-cellen een veilige en (kosten)effectieve behandeling zijn voor patiënten met auto-immuunziekten, vergeleken met de huidige standaardbehandeling. Ook onderzoeken we met geavanceerde laboratoriumtechnieken de werking van CAR T-cellen bij patiënten.

Or are you interested in focus on the reconstruction of two-Higgs decay channel into a pair of photons and a pair of b-quarks? We are delighted to offer 2 PhD positions at\nNikhef\n, where you will work for UvA.\nJoin Us!\nNikhef is the national institute for subatomic physics in the Netherlands. At Nikhef, approximately 220 physicists and 80 technical staff work together in an open and international scientific environment. Together they perform theoretical and experimental research in the fields of particle and astroparticle physics. Nikhef is a partnership between six major Dutch universities and NWO-I Foundation, the Institutes Organization of the Dutch Research Council (NWO). Among the research collaborations Nikhef participates in are the ALICE, ATLAS and LHCb experiments at CERN, the KM3NeT neutrino telescope in the Mediterranean, the Virgo gravitational waves interferometer in Pisa, the Xenon-nT dark matter experiment in Gran Sasso, the Pierre Auger cosmic ray observatory in Argentina, and the eEDM research programme in Groningen. There are also scientific groups on Theory, Physics Data Processing and Detector R&D. Nikhef avails over excellently equipped technical departments in mechanics, electronics and computing.\nThe Nikhef ATLAS group\nconsists of a total of 15 scientific staff, typically 5 postdocs and 15 PhD students. As a founding member of the ATLAS collaboration, the group has a long-term involvement in detector construction (the semiconductor tracker, barrel muon chambers, readout, alignment, and data acquisition). For the phase-2 upgrade (2027-2030), we will instrument and commission one of the end-caps of a new all-silicon inner tracking system (ITk) in Amsterdam, commission the High Granularity Timing Detector (HGTD), and develop the new universal readout system (FELIX) for ATLAS detector systems. The group also has a strong record in track reconstruction, flavour tagging algorithm development as well as physics data analysis, with a focus on Higgs boson physics, top quark physics, and searches for new physics signatures.\nThis is what you will do\nAfter the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012, one of the crucial future challenges for the LHC is to probe its most enigmatic property, the Higgs potential, which can manifest itself in LHC collisions through the production of Higgs boson pairs. These decays, which are 1000 times more rare than single Higgs production according to the Standard Model have not yet been observed. Observation of two-Higgs production is one the most important milestone for the LHC physics program, and will help constrain our knowledge of the Higgs potential, which has shaped the universe at its time of creation, and may hold strong clues about the existence of new physics beyond the Standard Model.\nPosition 1\nwill focus on the search for the extremely rare process of\nttHH production\nin LHC Run-3 data. This search will include all tt final states, and will include boosted final states. The analysis strategy is strongly focused on advanced machine learning techniques, developing attention-based transformer models that will directly classify events from the low-level data, rather than high-level objects, and which may ultimately include higher-level tasks such as Higgs boson mass regression for the analyzed data. The boosted object analysis will have a strong synergy with boosted analyses we are performing in other two-Higgs channels.\nThis position is co-supervised by prof. dr. Ivo van Vulpen, dr. Clara Nellist, and dr. Sascha Caron. The candidates is employed by the University of Amsterdam, is primarily based at Nikhef in Amsterdam\n.\nPosition 2\nwill focus on the reconstruction of two-Higgs decay channel into a pair of photons and a pair of b-quarks (\nHH\nà\nbb\nγγ\n) , which currently provides the tightest constraints, and on the\ncombined interpretation of all reconstructed diHiggs channels\n. Apart from the Run-3 diHiggs combination of all channels, which will provide the ultimate statement on diHiggs production that can be obtained with the LHC Run-3 data, a combination of single-Higgs, di-Higgs and triple-Higgs production measurements will allow to constrain the trilinear and quartic Higgs coupling, and thus the shape of the Higgs potential with unprecedented precision. In this position you will closely work together with PhD students involved in the main diHiggs channels (bbbb, bbττ and bbVV) for the combined interpretation and with a postdoc that is being recruited simultaneously that work on novel ML-based strategies to improve the precision of diHiggs combined interpretations.\nThis position is co-supervised by prof. dr. Wouter Verkerke, prof. dr. Tristan du Pree. The candidates is employed by the University of Amsterdam, is primarily based at Nikhef in Amsterdam\n.\nThe positions offered here are part of a NWO-funded physics program 'The potential of the Higgs boson', with prof. dr. Pamela Ferrari as principle investigator, which will ultimately comprise 7 PhD positions and 2 postdoc positions in the Nikhef ATLAS group in the period 2025-2030 all focused on the Higgs boson potential, complemented by 9 Nikhef staff scientists that offer supervision, networking opportunities and a specialized training program in data analysis techniques and Higgs boson physics.\nWhat we ask of you\nWe are looking for PhD candidates with an (almost) completed Master degree in high-energy physics or in a closely related field. The ideal candidate has a strong interest in data analysis, has good software skills (Python, C++, ROOT) and has (some) research experience in experimental particle physics. Experience with machine learning algorithms and software is desirable but not required.\nThis is what we offer you\nWe offer a temporary contract for 38 hours per week for the duration of 4 years (the initial contract will be for a period of 18 months and after satisfactory evaluation it will be extended for a total duration of 4 years).

In this project TU/e works together with Sleep Center Kempenhaeghe and Takeda to improve long-term, low-obtrusive monitoring of the sleep disorder narcolepsy and facilitate management of daytime complaints using digital health technology.\nInformation\nNarcolepsy is a chronic sleep disorder that typically imposes a substantial burden on those affected. People with narcolepsy often experience a broad range of symptoms, such as excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, and fragmented nocturnal sleep. Moreover, the spectrum of narcolepsy also includes symptoms that manifest more during daytime such as automatic behavior, cognitive impairments or mood disturbances. Symptoms greatly vary among patients and day-to-day variance can be considerable. Available narcolepsy questionnaires do not cover the full symptom spectrum and do not - or only retrospectively - capture symptom variability. Therefore, there is a clinical need for tools to monitor narcolepsy-related symptoms over time, to assess, describe, and predict the associated burden in daily life and evaluate the effect of treatment on everyday behaviors and experiences during sleep and wake.\nM-Health offers the opportunity to monitor user experiences during their daily routine over prolonged time, in a scalable manner. Sleep Medicine Center Kempenhaeghe developed the Narcolepsy Monitor, a digital research tool to gain insight into both the individual and synergetic burden of 20 narcolepsy symptoms over time. In this project, we aim to detailly expand our knowledge of the narcolepsy symptom spectrum, gain a better understanding of the inter-relation between patients’ symptoms and lived experiences, and advance longitudinal monitoring of disease burden. A better understanding of the symptoms and their dynamics over time as well as interindividual variability in the ecologies of specific symptoms can help to tailor treatment to the individual patient.\nTo facilitate the monitoring of narcolepsy-related symptoms with an m-Health application, it is important to understand which symptoms should be logged, and with which frequency, to map and better understand patients' lived experiences. Moreover, to mitigate user burden, monitoring should occur as minimally obtrusive and as engaging for a large audience as possible. Unobtrusive sensor technologies could complement self-reported data and may reduce the sampling frequency of self-reports.\nThe current project has three main aims, contributing to monitoring narcolepsy with an mHealth application:\n- Analyzing the Narcolepsy Monitor database to identify symptom clusters and to quantify dynamics of longitudinal disease burden. We will investigate associations between symptoms experienced by narcolepsy patients and assess temporal dynamics in the symptoms from a 24/7 perspective. To this end, we will analyze variations in symptom severity within days, across days, weeks, and explore variance over longer timeframes such as months. This will help us learn about which symptoms to monitor and at what time resolution.\n- Advancing insights about the integration of sensor data by analyzing self-reported data augmented with wearable data obtained through a new data collection campaign.\n- Understanding patient’s and healthcare professionals’ preferences in patient monitoring and co-creating and analyzing dashboards tailored to the needs of the different user groups (patients and healthcare professionals).\nIn this project, you will work in a multidisciplinary team which combines expertise on sleep medicine in general and narcolepsy in particular, together with longitudinal monitoring and digital health technology. This research will be conducted in both the Advanced Sleep Monitoring research group (Biomedical Diagnostics lab, Electrical Engineering) and the Human Technology interaction group (Industrial Engineering & Innovation Sciences) at the TU/e. You will work in close collaboration with Takeda and Sleep Medicine Center Kempenhaeghe. Kempenhaeghe is a tertiary expertise center for sleep medicine, with specific experience with diagnosis and treatment of narcolepsy patients.

      "description_en": "Will you advance the state-of-art in 6G communication networks? Optical wireless links using highly directional steerable laser beams can securely serve a high density of devices at high data rates. Your project optimizes energy efficiency and develops new features such as positioning and sensing.\nInformation\nYou will innovate Optical Wireless Communication (OWC) links. Laser beams promise wireless access in high-density locations (many devices per m2), high data rates via secure, interference-free, low latency connections. You will address the challenges to contain the energy consumption in such networks and to unleash further features, in particular positioning, tracking mobile devices, and sensing.\nBy addressing these research questions you contribute to making OWC technology mature for use in upcoming 6G wireless networks, which is a pressing research challenge. To build confidence in the reproducibility during scale up and integration in a sixth generation of mobile networks, 6G, dependable models are needed to improve power consumption (J/bit, watt/m2), coverage (bit/s*m2) or density (bit/s/m2). Such models are essential to optimize design choices and to make appropriate trade-offs.\nRadio systems (RF) are well understood thanks to decades of progress in research that resulted in highly optimized robust design choices. OWC borrows many principles and communication methods from RF. However, OWC differs from radio links in important aspects, that need to be taken into account in your study. These provide opportunities to build a stronger theoretical framework and to design and create better practical solutions.\nSocietal demands for wireless communication keep growing exponentially. The sixth generation (6G) of mobile networks strives to serve a ten fold increase in data traffic: AI applications exchange vast amounts of data between a rapidly increasing number of Internet of Things devices that will be wirelessly connected. Meanwhile, the power consumption of our communication infrastructure needs to be contained. 6G strives for substantial reduction in total power consumption, thus for a vast increase in energy efficiency per link or per communicated bit. The effort to connect all devices via radio links increases, and solutions are becoming increasingly sophisticated, for instance to use the limited amount of spectrum more efficiently.\nIn this project, you will join the frontier of innovation in 6G. In the Netherlands, a unique alliance of 60 top-notch telecom, ICT, semiconductor and photonics companies join forces with research institutions in various aspects of future of mobile networks technology. As a PhD student, you join this prestigious Future Network Services (FNS) flagship project, where research and entrepreneurial pursuits converge.\nYou will join the Signal Process Systems (SPS) group in the Electrical Engineering Department of TU Eindhoven. The SPS group has a strong track record not only in signal processing for digital communication, but also for medical applications and for intelligent lighting systems. The impact of the work of the group is evident from a very close cooperation with industrial partners and research institutes and from international recognition and awards of the team. The group is strong in creating novel information and communication theoretical principles in new fields by exploring the underlying physical mechanisms.",

        "title": "PhD on optical wireless communication supporting 6G Future Communication Networks",
        "description": "Will you advance the state-of-art in 6G communication networks? Optical wireless links using highly directional steerable laser beams can securely serve a high density of devices at high data rates. Your project optimizes energy efficiency and develops new features such as positioning and sensing.<br><br><strong>Information</strong><br>You will innovate Optical Wireless Communication (OWC) links. Laser beams promise wireless access in high-density locations (many devices per m2), high data rates via secure, interference-free, low latency connections. You will address the challenges to contain the energy consumption in such networks and to unleash further features, in particular positioning, tracking mobile devices, and sensing.<br><br>By addressing these research questions you contribute to making OWC technology mature for use in upcoming 6G wireless networks, which is a pressing research challenge. To build confidence in the reproducibility during scale up and integration in a sixth generation of mobile networks, 6G, dependable models are needed to improve power consumption (J/bit, watt/m2), coverage (bit/s*m2) or density (bit/s/m2). Such models are essential to optimize design choices and to make appropriate trade-offs.<br><br>Radio systems (RF) are well understood thanks to decades of progress in research that resulted in highly optimized robust design choices. OWC borrows many principles and communication methods from RF. However, OWC differs from radio links in important aspects, that need to be taken into account in your study. These provide opportunities to build a stronger theoretical framework and to design and create better practical solutions.<br><br>Societal demands for wireless communication keep growing exponentially. The sixth generation (6G) of mobile networks strives to serve a ten fold increase in data traffic: AI applications exchange vast amounts of data between a rapidly increasing number of Internet of Things devices that will be wirelessly connected. Meanwhile, the power consumption of our communication infrastructure needs to be contained. 6G strives for substantial reduction in total power consumption, thus for a vast increase in energy efficiency per link or per communicated bit. The effort to connect all devices via radio links increases, and solutions are becoming increasingly sophisticated, for instance to use the limited amount of spectrum more efficiently.<br><br>In this project, you will join the frontier of innovation in 6G. In the Netherlands, a unique alliance of 60 top-notch telecom, ICT, semiconductor and photonics companies join forces with research institutions in various aspects of future of mobile networks technology. As a PhD student, you join this prestigious Future Network Services (FNS) flagship project, where research and entrepreneurial pursuits converge.<br><br>You will join the Signal Process Systems (SPS) group in the Electrical Engineering Department of TU Eindhoven. The SPS group has a strong track record not only in signal processing for digital communication, but also for medical applications and for intelligent lighting systems. The impact of the work of the group is evident from a very close cooperation with industrial partners and research institutes and from international recognition and awards of the team. The group is strong in creating novel information and communication theoretical principles in new fields by exploring the underlying physical mechanisms.",

      "description_en": "The faculty of Science and the Schneider group within the Leiden Institute of Chemistry are looking for a PhD candidate to join us in the Laboratory of 2D materials.\n“Ion transport and synthesis of two dimensional nanopores and nanoporous membranes”\nDisciplines: ion transport chemistry and physics, nanopores, energy devices, fuel cells, osmotic energy, membrane chemistry and physics, organic chemistry\nAbout the Project 2DPolymembrane\nCurrent separation technology is crucial for many aspects of human life and accounts for ~15% of the world’s energy consumption. Additionally, in the development of next-generation power solutions based on fuel cells and ion batteries, the membrane is an essential component that directly determines device efficiency. While the particle flow through separation columns is directional at the atomistic scale, undirected Brownian motion dominates in state-of-the-art membranes. 2D membranes have the potential to overcome this intrinsic deficiency and shift the paradigm of particle transport from disordered Brownian motion to unidirectional flow. In the project we will develop 2D polymer heterostructure membranes (2DHMs) combined with functionalized graphene. They offer ultimate thinness (leading to shortest diffusion lengths), precision pore geometry/size (resulting in high size-selectivity, even for hydrogen isotopes), and high functionality (fostering chemical/charge selectivity and ionic gating), making them ideal membrane materials to realize selective and unidirectional ion transport. We will combine theory and prediction, chemical design, and on-water/liquid surface synthesis, as well as in-situ ion transport investigations to develop robust 2DHMs. We will synthesize 2DHMs in the form of horizontal and vertical heterostructures, for which reliable structure property correlations will be established. We will take advantage of lattice vibrations, nuclear quantum, and electrochemical effects, and consequently reformulate classical diffusion theory to consider these game changers. As a result, we will achieve innovative 2DHMs for selective proton and ion transport with high permeance, laying the foundations for the next-generation membrane technologies. 2DPolymembrane will unlock the unique opportunities of 2DHMs for innovative energy device integrations (proton/aqueous metal batteries, fuel cells, and reverse osmotic power generators), where the merits of ultrathin precision 2DHMs will result in the highest selectivity and highest particle flow, and thus a fundamental device performance beyond the state-of-art.\nThe PhD students will be supervised by Grégory Schneider (Leiden Institute of Chemistry), and work in close collaboration with the teams at the Max Planck Institute of Microstructure Physics (Prof. Xinliang Feng) and at the Dresden University of Technology (Prof. Thomas Heine).\nAbout the ERC Synergy Grant Poly2DMembrane\nSee:\nEuropean grants for research on ultrathin membranes and the biological clock in bacteria - Leiden University\nSeparation processes are essential in our daily lives, from drug development and purification to cleaning wastewater. These processes, however, use a lot of energy due to the thicknesses of the membranes, together with the random movement of particles. The 2DPolyMembrane project is working to change that paradigm. By developing special 2D membranes that allow particles to flow in a single direction, this project could significantly improve the efficiency of separation technologies.\nAbout the University\nLeiden University is one of Europe’s leading international research universities.\nThanks to its committed and inspired staff and students, the university enjoys a leading role in academic research and education. Leiden also scores very well every year in prominent rankings. This means that, to maintain our position, the bar is set very high.

Wil je bijdragen aan het ontwikkelen en evalueren van een innovatie in de huisartsenzorg? De afdeling Huisartsgeneeskunde van de Universiteit Maastricht zoekt een promovendus om praktijkgericht onderzoek te verrichten.\nPromovendus - Infectieziekten als casus voor data gedreven verbetering in de huisartsenpraktijk\n- Ons doel: De huisartsenzorg verbeteren met behulp van kunstmatige intelligentie, voor betere diagnostiek, datakwaliteit en patiëntenzorg.\nOns doel:\n- Jouw collega’s: Huisartsen, onderzoekers en patiënten die samen werken aan de huisartsenzorg van de toekomst.\nJouw collega’s:\nHuisartsen verzamelen dagelijks grote hoeveelheden waardevolle patiëntgegevens, deels gestructureerd en gestandaardiseerd, maar een substantieel deel bestaat uit vrije tekst uit consultverslagen. Deze ongestructureerde data wordt momenteel nog maar beperkt benut. Dankzij de opkomst van AI, en met name krachtige taalmodellen zoals BERT en GPT, ontstaan er nieuwe kansen om deze informatie effectief om te zetten in praktische ondersteuning bij diagnostiek, prognose en datakwaliteit. Dit onderzoeksproject richt zich daarbij op infectieziekten, zoals urineweginfectie en longontsteking - aandoeningen die tot de meest voorkomende klachten in de huisartspraktijk behoren.\nBinnen dit project onderzoek je hoe AI een rol kan spelen in het verbeteren van de huisartsenzorg bij infectieziekten. Je werkt aan het ontwikkelen en valideren van AI-modellen voor diagnostiek en risicovoorspelling, en onderzoekt hoe deze technologie kan bijdragen aan betere registratie en datakwaliteit. Tegelijkertijd breng je in kaart hoe huisartsen en patiënten aankijken tegen het gebruik van AI in de dagelijkse praktijk. Je maakt gebruik van rijke, bestaande huisartsendata en werkt samen met meerdere academische netwerken verspreid over Nederland, samen goed voor gegevens van maar liefst 1,5 miljoen patiënten.\nVanaf 2025 is de vakgroep Huisartsgeneeskunde bovendien gestart met het inrichten van een academische werkplaats huisartsenzorg. Het doel van deze werkplaats is het ontwikkelen van nieuwe kennis en het gebruik daarvan in de praktijk te bevorderen, via een betere samen- en wisselwerking tussen huisartsenorganisaties en universiteit. De vakgroep is daarin actief vanuit twee fysieke ‘hubs’: Maastricht en Eindhoven. Deze dynamische omgeving biedt daarmee extra kansen jezelf tijdens dit promotietraject te ontwikkelen, en werken is vanuit beide locaties mogelijk.\nDoor praktijkgericht onderzoek te combineren met technologische innovatie, draag je bij aan de veilige en verantwoorde inzet van AI in de eerstelijnszorg. Dit project biedt dan ook een unieke kans om medische inhoud te combineren met technologische innovatie. Je werkt in een maatschappelijk relevant domein, met directe impact op de dagelijkse zorg. Samen met zorgverleners, patiënten en onderzoekers bouw je aan de huisartsenzorg van de toekomst.\nWat ga je doen?\n- Het ontwikkelen en valideren van AI-modellen op basis van gestructureerde en ongestructureerde huisartsdata\n- Het uitvoeren van kwalitatief onderzoek naar de perspectieven van huisartsen en patiënten op het gebruik van AI\n- Het samenwerken met onderzoekers, data scientists, zorgprofessionals en netwerkpartners in een multidisciplinaire setting\n- Het vertalen van onderzoeksresultaten naar praktische aanbevelingen voor zorg, beleid en onderwijs\n- Het schrijven van wetenschappelijke artikelen en rapportages over de bevindingen\nBen jij klaar om koers te zetten voor de komende jaren? Dan ontmoeten we je graag.\nWat jij meebrengt\nHet gaat ons niet om vinkjes, maar om jouw motivatie, leergierigheid en aanpak. Herken jij jezelf hierin?\n- Een afgeronde universitaire masteropleiding biomedische technologie, biomedische wetenschappen, (technische) geneeskunde, gezondheidswetenschappen, of gelijke strekking;\n- Interesse in innovaties in de huisartspraktijk, big data en AI/LLM. Ervaring met deze technologieën is een pré.\n- Affiniteit met wetenschappelijk onderzoek, zowel kwalitatief als kwantitatief;\n- Goede organisatorische en communicatieve vaardigheden, in zowel Nederlands als Engels;\n- Een zelfstandige, nauwkeurige werkhouding én plezier in samenwerken met een interdisciplinair team.\n- Ervaring met wetenschappelijk schrijven is een pré.\nWat je van ons mag verwachten\nBij de Universiteit Maastricht werk je in een internationale, open en betrokken omgeving. We bieden:\n- Een jaarcontract, bij wederzijdse tevredenheid wordt het contract verlengd met 3 jaar.\n- Een bruto salaris tussen €3.059 en €3.881 bruto per maand (bij een fulltime dienstverband van 38 uur per week), exclusief 8% vakantiegeld en een 8,3% eindejaarsuitkering.\n- 29 vakantiedagen (op basis van fulltime), vier extra vrije dagen, en de mogelijkheid om 12 extra dagen op te bouwen via compensatie-uren.\n- Flexibele werktijden, een thuiswerkvergoeding en hybride werken.\n- Vrijheid en ruimte om je werk zelfstandig in te richten en je eigen ideeën te ontwikkelen.\n- Een hechte community van collega’s waarmee je nauw samenwerkt.\n- Een goede pensioenregeling via het ABP, bedrijfsfitness en toegang tot een uitgebreid sportaanbod.\n- Een inspirerende werkomgeving in het hart van Europa.\nOver de Faculty of Health, Medicine and Life Sciences (FHML)\nFHML werkt aan gezondheid in de breedste zin van het woord: van molecuul tot mens, en van gezondheidszorg tot preventie. We leiden zorgprofessionals en onderzoekers op binnen innovatieve onderwijsprogramma’s, en doen baanbrekend onderzoek op het gebied van gezondheid en welzijn. Als onderdeel van het Maastricht UMC+ (MUMC+) vormt onze internationale en interdisciplinaire gemeenschap een unieke samenwerking tussen universiteit en academisch ziekenhuis, waar onderwijs, onderzoek en zorg samenkomen.\nCAPHRI\nOnze vakgroep is onderdeel van onderzoeksinstituut CAPHRI, dat zich inzet voor betere gezondheid door innovatief, praktijkgericht en maatschappelijk relevant onderzoek. CAPHRI verbindt wetenschap en samenleving via participatief onderzoek binnen de publieke en eerstelijnszorg en persoonsgerichte langdurige zorg. De vakgroep huisartsgeneeskunde heeft wetenschappelijke speerpunten: Huisarts & Diagnostiek, Huisarts & Digitale Zorg en Samen beslissen & interprofessioneel samenwerken.

      "description_en": "To heat our houses and offices with a lower carbon footprint, efficient and low-cost heat storage solutions such as organic phase change materials (PCM) hold great promise. To design efficient and low-cost PCM composites the RecyWax+ project combines multi-physics modelling approaches and physical experimentation of the thermal properties of the PCM composite. Throughout, theory is validated by synthesis and assembly of concrete PCMs. RecyWax+ offers a PhD position for molecular-dynamics simulations of novel PCM systems for thermal storage.\nRecywax+\nis supported within the Dutch Research Council\nNWO OTP programme\n, and is led by profs.\nAlexey Lyulin\n,\nHeiner Friedrich\nand\nHenk Huinink\n(all TU/e) and prof.\nBernard Geurts\n(U Twente). The project explores how waste products can be turned into a sustainable battery for thermal storage. The idea is to combine waxes obtained through pyrolysis of plastic waste streams, with ultra-conductive graphene networks, i.e., nanometer sized carbon platelets that transport heat at tremendous conductivity. This creates a compact and efficient system for thermal energy storage, exploiting phase transition to store thermal energy in terms of an increased temperature, as well as a reversible change of phase from solid to liquid. Think of it as a heat battery that charges and discharges similarly to a regular battery, but with heat instead of electricity.\nRecywax+\naims to develop the next generation of PCM composites extracted from upcycled polymer pyrolysis waste streams and thermally conductive fillers. In this PhD project we adopt a molecular modelling approach with which we address the following steps/questions:\n- Characterize the molecular structure and molecular distribution of suitable polymer pyrolysis waste streams to aid modelling of filler-matrix interfaces;\n- Modeling (using Gromacs and LAMMPS software packages and MARTINI-like upscaling) the filler-matrix interfaces to optimize thermal transport, e.g., by functionalization of the nanofiller surface;\n- Simulate and advise on the ideal filler-filler contacts and filler-matrix interface structure; this interface should be such that the fillers are finely dispersed in the matrix, yet still enabling good filler-filler contacts;\n- Connect sub-micron, atomistic properties of the interface to macroscopic network scales, predict thermal conductivity, and develop practical strategies to drastically increase thermal conductivity;",

        "title": "PhD position on Multiscale Modelling of Recycled Wax for Sustainable Thermal Storage (RecyWax+)",
        "description": "To heat our houses and offices with a lower carbon footprint, efficient and low-cost heat storage solutions such as organic phase change materials (PCM) hold great promise. To design efficient and low-cost PCM composites the RecyWax+ project combines multi-physics modelling approaches and physical experimentation of the thermal properties of the PCM composite. Throughout, theory is validated by synthesis and assembly of concrete PCMs. RecyWax+ offers a PhD position for molecular-dynamics simulations of novel PCM systems for thermal storage.<br><br><strong>Recywax+</strong> is supported within the Dutch Research Council <a href=\"https://www.nwo.nl/en/researchprogrammes/open-technology-programme\">NWO OTP programme</a>, and is led by profs. <strong>Alexey Lyulin</strong>,<strong> Heiner Friedrich</strong> and <strong>Henk Huinink</strong> (all TU/e) and prof. <strong>Bernard Geurts</strong> (U Twente). The project explores how waste products can be turned into a sustainable battery for thermal storage. The idea is to combine waxes obtained through pyrolysis of plastic waste streams, with ultra-conductive graphene networks, i.e., nanometer sized carbon platelets that transport heat at tremendous conductivity. This creates a compact and efficient system for thermal energy storage, exploiting phase transition to store thermal energy in terms of an increased temperature, as well as a reversible change of phase from solid to liquid. Think of it as a heat battery that charges and discharges similarly to a regular battery, but with heat instead of electricity.<br><br><strong>Recywax+</strong> aims to develop the next generation of PCM composites extracted from upcycled polymer pyrolysis waste streams and thermally conductive fillers. In this PhD project we adopt a molecular modelling approach with which we address the following steps/questions:<br><ul> <li>Characterize the molecular structure and molecular distribution of suitable polymer pyrolysis waste streams to aid modelling of filler-matrix interfaces;</li> <li>Modeling (using Gromacs and LAMMPS software packages and MARTINI-like upscaling) the filler-matrix interfaces to optimize thermal transport, e.g., by functionalization of the nanofiller surface;</li> <li>Simulate and advise on the ideal filler-filler contacts and filler-matrix interface structure; this interface should be such that the fillers are finely dispersed in the matrix, yet still enabling good filler-filler contacts;</li> <li>Connect sub-micron, atomistic properties of the interface to macroscopic network scales, predict thermal conductivity, and develop practical strategies to drastically increase thermal conductivity;</li>\n</ul>",

Join us on our journey to ensure Safe Operation of Military Systems.\nJob description\nJoin the Corrosion Technology and Electrochemistry (CTE) group, part of the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, in close collaboration with the Netherlands Defence Academy. The CTE group is a dynamic team of researchers, including PhD candidates, postdocs, and faculty members. Our group focuses on understanding and mitigating corrosion processes, and on the development of electrocatalysts and electrochemical sensors through the synthesis of materials and the use of advanced electrochemical methods and surface analysis techniques. We aim to deepen the fundamental knowledge of electrochemistry and surface science and translate this into practical, sustainable solutions for energy and materials applications.\nIncreasingly strict performance requirements for components lead to new material combinations and potential corrosion problems. The most dangerous of these are highly localized. Localized corrosion under a coating is however typically difficult to detect visually. Electrochemical Noise (EN) can detect this at an early stage and is not limited by geometric characteristics. Moreover, EN measures passively and continuously, making it very suitable for permanent monitoring or as an accelerated testing method. The effectiveness of EN depends on effective data analysis. Until now, specific EN fingerprints of localized corrosion are determined manually. This is a tedious procedure that requires considerable expert knowledge. Artificial intelligence or machine learning (AI/ML) models can offer a solution here.\nThis project aims to determine to what extent AI/ML models based on electrochemical sensor data are able to identify and quantify local forms of corrosion. We are looking for a skilled PhD researcher to investigate these models, together with the Netherlands Defence Academy. Your work as a PhD researcher involves the following:\n- Determining the required discrimination ability for classification and quantification of corrosion phenomena, e.g. differences and similarities in data between crevice- and different forms of pitting corrosion.\n- Investigating which types of AI/ML models can meet these requirements.\n- (Further) developing suitable AI/ML models.\n- Investigating which requirements the training data for the AI/ML models must meet, including type, quantity, and number of corrosion classes.\n- Performing laboratory experiments to validate the corrosion classification and -quantification for representative forms of corrosion that typically cause problems in military systems.\n- Further validation on field data from actual military systems.\nTU Delft (Delft University of Technology)\nDelft University of Technology is built on strong foundations. As creators of the world-famous Dutch waterworks and pioneers in biotech, TU Delft is a top international university combining science, engineering and design.

We aim to deepen the fundamental knowledge of electrochemistry and surface science and translate this into practical, sustainable solutions for energy and materials applications.<br><br>Increasingly strict performance requirements for components lead to new material combinations and potential corrosion problems. The most dangerous of these are highly localized. Localized corrosion under a coating is however typically difficult to detect visually. Electrochemical Noise (EN) can detect this at an early stage and is not limited by geometric characteristics. Moreover, EN measures passively and continuously, making it very suitable for permanent monitoring or as an accelerated testing method. The effectiveness of EN depends on effective data analysis. Until now, specific EN fingerprints of localized corrosion are determined manually. This is a tedious procedure that requires considerable expert knowledge. Artificial intelligence or machine learning (AI/ML) models can offer a solution here.<br><br>This project aims to determine to what extent AI/ML models based on electrochemical sensor data are able to identify and quantify local forms of corrosion. We are looking for a skilled PhD researcher to investigate these models, together with the Netherlands Defence Academy. Your work as a PhD researcher involves the following:<br><ol> <li>Determining the required discrimination ability for classification and quantification of corrosion phenomena, e.g. differences and similarities in data between crevice- and different forms of pitting corrosion.</li> <li>Investigating which types of AI/ML models can meet these requirements.</li> <li>(Further) developing suitable AI/ML models.</li> <li>Investigating which requirements the training data for the AI/ML models must meet, including type, quantity, and number of corrosion classes.</li> <li>Performing laboratory experiments to validate the corrosion classification and -quantification for representative forms of corrosion that typically cause problems in military systems.</li> <li>Further validation on field data from actual military systems.</li>\n</ol>\n<br><strong>Job requirements </strong><br>Job requirements:<br><ul> <li>MSc degree in Materials Science, Metallurgy, Mechanical Engineering, Chemical Engineering or a related field.</li> <li>Proficiency with Data Science techniques.</li> <li>Excellent analytical skills, initiative, inventiveness, curiosity, diligence, and critical thinking.</li> <li>Ability to work with scientific and industrial partners.</li> <li>Strong communication skills (high English proficiency), team player, and good social behaviour.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>The following will make you stand out:<br><ul> <li>Creative, open-minded, and proactive researcher.</li> <li>Excellent experimental, analytical, and problem-solving skills.</li> <li>Self-driven attitude, creativity and autonomy.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>Important note: due to the specific nature of the subject, this vacancy is only applicable for Dutch and/or EU/NATO nationalities.

      "description_en": "Join our ERC SPHINX Team to model how climate risks ripple through housing markets. Help uncover when homes become stranded assets and fuel systemic impacts. Help shaping climate resilient policies!\nJob description\nThis 4-year fully funded PhD position is part of the ERC Consolidator project “Systemic physical climate risk in complex adaptive economies” (SPHINX). The SPHINX-research program is made possible thanks to a 2-million-euro grant from the European Research Council.\nBackground:\nGlobally, climate change already manifests via physical risks – damages from floods, storms, wildfires, heatwaves, droughts, and sea-level rise. Concerns are rising that these risks may become systemic, when local damages to one element cannot be contained and adversely affect the entire socio-economic system. Usually, physical climate risk assessments overlay hazard probability, exposure and vulnerability. These future damage estimates linearly extrapolate historic data, assuming that markets efficiently capitalize full information about climate risks and adjust gradually, economic actors have perfect future insight, and socio-economic systems will react to and price unprecedented climate-induced hazards as they did in the past. This approach is criticized for underestimating the true costs of climate change (e.g., at just 1-3% of GDP loss even under severe scenarios), impeding climate action. In contrast, analysis of systemic risks embraces complex interactions among elements/agents, adjusting expectations, mechanisms of contagion dynamics, feedbacks, and non-linear tipping. The SPHINX research program aims to fundamentally advance simulation methods and consolidate novel data to understand how systemic physical climate risks emerge in the socio-economic system, and to explore strategies to curtail their spiraling costs. The project focuses on Europe, with a detailed analysis of three selected case-study regions. Methodologically, SPHINX embraces five pillars, ranging from data collection to agent-based and computable general equilibrium modeling, led by five team members. The first three pillars concern the development of computational agent-based models to explore three different channels of risk propagation with a focus on the triggers of systemic risks. The current PhD position aims to advance assessments of physical climate risks for governments, including the emergence of moral hazard and inequality in the allocation of climate adaptation funding, as well as collateral damage to their budgets.\nJob description:\nThe successful candidate will work within the SPHINX research team to explore how governments balance economic development objectives with adaptation to accelerating physical climate risks, as households-voters decide where to live given their preferences for public adaptation. To explore the emergence of moral hazard and fiscal strain for governments under shifting climate risks, the candidate will develop an agent-based model grounded in the Tiebout theory and supported by data, including data on public preferences for allocating adaptation funds. During this 4-year-long project, the PhD student will build on the latest progress in economic research on changes in governmental debt and collateral fiscal damages, and instances of moral hazard and loss of creditworthiness for governments facing escalating climate risks. Connecting the mutually dependent decisions of governments to provide and fund public adaptation, and the location choices of diverse private actors in an agent-based model will be essential here. This modeling effort will benefit from the behavioral data on expectations elicited via tailored household and firm surveys (carried out by another team member) and other spatial and physical climate risk data. The goal of this agent-based modeling is to identify conditions under which risk contagion causes regional decline, and the roots of changing inequality based on how local governments decide on the level of public adaptation provision contingent on both households’ preferences for it and the availability of sufficient tax-based governmental budgets to afford it.\nTU Delft (Delft University of Technology)\nDelft University of Technology is built on strong foundations. As creators of the world-famous Dutch waterworks and pioneers in biotech, TU Delft is a top international university combining science, engineering and design.

        "description": "<strong><em>Join our ERC SPHINX Team to model how climate risks ripple through housing markets. Help uncover when homes become stranded assets and fuel systemic impacts. Help shaping climate resilient policies!</em></strong><br><br><strong>Job description</strong><br>This 4-year fully funded PhD position is part of the ERC Consolidator project “Systemic physical climate risk in complex adaptive economies” (SPHINX). The SPHINX-research program is made possible thanks to a 2-million-euro grant from the European Research Council.<br><br>Background:<br><br>Globally, climate change already manifests via physical risks – damages from floods, storms, wildfires, heatwaves, droughts, and sea-level rise. Concerns are rising that these risks may become systemic, when local damages to one element cannot be contained and adversely affect the entire socio-economic system. Usually, physical climate risk assessments overlay hazard probability, exposure and vulnerability. These future damage estimates linearly extrapolate historic data, assuming that markets efficiently capitalize full information about climate risks and adjust gradually, economic actors have perfect future insight, and socio-economic systems will react to and price unprecedented climate-induced hazards as they did in the past. This approach is criticized for underestimating the true costs of climate change (e.g., at just 1-3% of GDP loss even under severe scenarios), impeding climate action. In contrast, analysis of systemic risks embraces complex interactions among elements/agents, adjusting expectations, mechanisms of contagion dynamics, feedbacks, and non-linear tipping. The SPHINX research program aims to fundamentally advance simulation methods and consolidate novel data to understand how systemic physical climate risks emerge in the socio-economic system, and to explore strategies to curtail their spiraling costs. The project focuses on Europe, with a detailed analysis of three selected case-study regions. Methodologically, SPHINX embraces five pillars, ranging from data collection to agent-based and computable general equilibrium modeling, led by five team members. The first three pillars concern the development of computational agent-based models to explore three different channels of risk propagation with a focus on the triggers of systemic risks. The current PhD position aims to advance assessments of physical climate risks for governments, including the emergence of moral hazard and inequality in the allocation of climate adaptation funding, as well as collateral damage to their budgets.<br><br>Job description:<br><br>The successful candidate will work within the SPHINX research team to explore how governments balance economic development objectives with adaptation to accelerating physical climate risks, as households-voters decide where to live given their preferences for public adaptation. To explore the emergence of moral hazard and fiscal strain for governments under shifting climate risks, the candidate will develop an agent-based model grounded in the Tiebout theory and supported by data, including data on public preferences for allocating adaptation funds. During this 4-year-long project, the PhD student will build on the latest progress in economic research on changes in governmental debt and collateral fiscal damages, and instances of moral hazard and loss of creditworthiness for governments facing escalating climate risks. Connecting the mutually dependent decisions of governments to provide and fund public adaptation, and the location choices of diverse private actors in an agent-based model will be essential here. This modeling effort will benefit from the behavioral data on expectations elicited via tailored household and firm surveys (carried out by another team member) and other spatial and physical climate risk data. The goal of this agent-based modeling is to identify conditions under which risk contagion causes regional decline, and the roots of changing inequality based on how local governments decide on the level of public adaptation provision contingent on both households’ preferences for it and the availability of sufficient tax-based governmental budgets to afford it.<br><br><strong>Job requirements</strong><br>A candidate should ideally have:<br><ul> <li>MSc in Environmental Economics, Spatial Economics, Computational Science, Geography, Environmental Studies, or Engineering &amp; Policy Analysis;</li> <li>Knowledge of a programming language (Python, Julia, etc) and training in any of the simulation methods;</li> <li>Experience with (statistical) data analysis;</li> <li>Previous experience with agent-based modeling or any type of spatial modeling is beneficial;</li> <li>Ability to work with spatial data/GIS is an asset;</li> <li>Domain knowledge in the field of coupled social-environmental systems, climate change or global environmental change in general is an advantage;</li> <li>Solid problem-solving skills and capacity to take the initiative;</li> <li>fluent written and spoken English.

Bij de vakgroep Healthcare Governance (HCG) van Erasmus School of Health Policy & Management (ESHPM) zijn wij op zoek naar een gemotiveerde en enthousiaste promovendus die etnografisch actieonderzoek wil doen naar samenwerking tussen verschillende publieke organisaties, tech bedrijven, mantelzorgers en ouderen met als gemeenschappelijke uitdaging: hoe maken we samenredzame buurten van de toekomst met behulp van nieuwe zorgrelaties tussen professionals, ouderen en familie, met oog voor waarden en met passende inzet van technologie?\nProjectbeschrijving\nDe Nederlandse gezondheidszorg staat voor grote uitdagingen door de snel vergrijzende bevolking. Deze demografische verschuiving zorgt voor een toenemende zorgvraag en druk op professionele zorgverlening. Om de druk op deze formele zorg te verlichten, pleit de Nederlandse overheid voor een maatschappelijke transitie van ‘ouderenzorg’ naar ‘zorg voor ouderen’. Hierin worden ouderen gestimuleerd om zo lang mogelijk thuis te wonen en zorg in hun eigen omgeving te ontvangen, ondersteund door een actievere rol voor mantelzorgers. Hoewel de noodzaak van deze transitie door veel partijen wordt erkend, brengt deze ook grote uitdagingen met zich mee. Veel mantelzorgers staan namelijk nu al voor enorme lasten, vaak in combinatie met werk en andere verplichtingen.\nIn hun zoektocht naar oplossingen brengen politici, beleidsmakers en zorgorganisaties twee verschillende richtingen naar voren. De eerste richting is het versterken van\nsamenredzaamheid\n. Het centrale idee achter samenredzaamheid is het faciliteren van thuis wonen door middel van nieuwe (informele) zorgnetwerken, waarin zorgverlening als een collectieve inspanning wordt gezien, die is gebaseerd op ondersteuning binnen gemeenschappen. De tweede richting is\ntechnologische innovatie\nals middel om zelfredzaamheid te bevorderen. Technologie en digitalisering worden gezien als cruciale instrumenten om de ouderenzorg duurzaam te houden, taken te automatiseren die traditioneel door formele zorgverleners worden uitgevoerd en ziekenhuisbezoeken te verminderen.\nHoewel samenredzaamheid en technologische innovatie beide gericht zijn op het aanpakken van dezelfde crisis, worden ze grotendeels los van elkaar nagestreefd. In de ontwikkeling van technologie is daardoor vaak weinig oog voor de rol van (informele) zorggemeenschappen, terwijl beleids- en buurtinitiatieven op het terrein van samenredzaamheid vaak weinig aandacht hebben voor mogelijke manieren waarop technologie dit soort initiatieven zou kunnen ondersteunen. Een belangrijke reden hiervoor is dat deze twee oplossingsrichtingen lijken te vertrekken vanuit verschillende onderliggende\nwaarden\n. Zo richt veel technologie zich op efficiëntie en optimalisatie van processen, terwijl initiatieven op het terrein van samenredzaamheid juist relationele verbondenheid hoog in het vaandel hebben staan. Het gevolg is dat veel technologische innovaties op weerstand stuiten, beperkte acceptatie en moeizame inbedding in informele praktijken van zorgverlening, terwijl initiatieven gericht op samenredzaamheid technologische oplossingen niet benutten. Kortom: technologische innovaties passen vaak niet vanzelf in de sociale praktijken van informele netwerken terwijl omgekeerd deze initiatieven de meerwaarde van technologie niet zondermeer zien of omarmen.\nWat ga je doen?\nAls promovendus voer je etnografisch actieonderzoek uit naar een complex en actueel publiek vraagstuk dat in heel Nederland speelt: hoe kunnen verschillende organisaties samenwerken aan een duurzame organisatie van samenredzame buurten waarbij de inzet van technologie goed aansluit bij waarden van ouderen die langer thuis wonen? Partijen die aan je onderzoek meewerken zijn o.a. ouderenorganisaties, verzekeraars, mantelzorgorganisaties, welzijnsinstanties en gemeenten. Zij geven ieder een eigen invulling aan samenredzaamheid en de inzet van technologie thuis. En zij hebben vaak verschillende waarden en belangen die soms botsen in de samenwerking.

      "description_en": "Do you want to be part of a large scale national project and work on multi-commodity energy districts?\nThe envisioned research is part of the research program Intelligent Energy Systems (IES) performed within the Electrical Energy Systems (EES) group of TU/e. Within the IES program, research is conducted into operation and planning of future sustainable energy systems, with an emphasis on electricity systems, markets and systems integration. This research is performed in two research labs: the Digital power and energy systems lab (EES DigiPES lab) and the Electricity markets and power system optimization lab (EES EMPDO lab). The former focuses on intelligent energy network research, including: demand management and flexibility, digital twinning, data analytics, smart grid ICT architectures and systems integration in multi energy systems. The latter specializes in electricity market design (centralized & decentralized), market products & system services to integrate new technologies, forecasting, market participation strategies and risk management, large-scale, distributed, multi-objective optimization techniques applied to energy markets and power systems and AI for optimization and control in power and energy systems. The EES group has strong ties with industry both nationally and internationally, with several part-time industry researchers working in the group and a large group of strategic collaboration partners.\nRecently, the Electrical Energy Systems group received grants for nationally-funded projects in Intelligent Electricity Systems. Therefore, this group currently has multiple vacancies in this field.\nWe are currently looking for researchers with strong energy systems knowledge, electricity, heat, and gas netwrok modelling & simulation, and research software development skills\nthat want to develop cutting-edge knowledge and software for the\nenergy transition. The focus of the work will be on the application of intelligent software approaches (distributed control systems, distributed optimization, market mechanisms, multi-scale modelling, etc.), in electrical power systems (energy system flexibility coordination, local energy markets, capacity & congestion management, etc.).\nInformation\nThe transition to sustainable urban energy systems is a cornerstone of climate-neutral cities. Positive Energy Districts (PEDs) are emerging as a key concept in this transition, aiming to produce more energy than they consume on an annual basis. However, the operation of PEDs is increasingly complex due to the integration of multiple energy vectors (electricity, heating, gas, water, etc.), the variability of renewable energy sources, and the need for real-time coordination among distributed assets.\nResilience —the ability of a system to anticipate, absorb, adapt to, and rapidly recover from disruptions— is a critical yet underexplored dimension in PED operations. This research is a part of an NWO project called “Enabling Positive Energy Districs through citizen-centered socio-technical models for upscaling pf the heat transition” or EmPowerED that studies various aspects of the PEDs to deliver a theoretically informed and empirically validated scalable integrated systems co-creation approach for carbon-neutral heating that can be tailored to the specific local PED context. This PhD is part of the technical study and modelling of the project that needs to focus on a resilience-oriented operational framework for multi-commodity PEDs, addressing both steady-state optimization and dynamic response to disturbances. EmPowerED is a large project with around 38 partners including different universities, research institutes, municipalities, energy communities, distribution system operators, and technology providers. The student will have the opportunity to be a part of this project and participate in project meetings, contribute to the discussion with the end-users, energy communities, and municipalities.

        "description": "<strong><em>Do you want to be part of a large scale national project and work on multi-commodity energy districts?</em></strong><br><br>The envisioned research is part of the research program Intelligent Energy Systems (IES) performed within the Electrical Energy Systems (EES) group of TU/e. Within the IES program, research is conducted into operation and planning of future sustainable energy systems, with an emphasis on electricity systems, markets and systems integration. This research is performed in two research labs: the Digital power and energy systems lab (EES DigiPES lab) and the Electricity markets and power system optimization lab (EES EMPDO lab). The former focuses on intelligent energy network research, including: demand management and flexibility, digital twinning, data analytics, smart grid ICT architectures and systems integration in multi energy systems. The latter specializes in electricity market design (centralized &amp; decentralized), market products &amp; system services to integrate new technologies, forecasting, market participation strategies and risk management, large-scale, distributed, multi-objective optimization techniques applied to energy markets and power systems and AI for optimization and control in power and energy systems. The EES group has strong ties with industry both nationally and internationally, with several part-time industry researchers working in the group and a large group of strategic collaboration partners.<br><br>Recently, the Electrical Energy Systems group received grants for nationally-funded projects in Intelligent Electricity Systems. Therefore, this group currently has multiple vacancies in this field. <strong>We are currently looking for researchers with strong energy systems knowledge, electricity, heat, and gas netwrok modelling &amp; simulation, and research software development skills </strong>that want to develop cutting-edge knowledge and software for the <strong></strong>energy transition. The focus of the work will be on the application of intelligent software approaches (distributed control systems, distributed optimization, market mechanisms, multi-scale modelling, etc.), in electrical power systems (energy system flexibility coordination, local energy markets, capacity &amp; congestion management, etc.).<br><br><strong>Information</strong><br>The transition to sustainable urban energy systems is a cornerstone of climate-neutral cities. Positive Energy Districts (PEDs) are emerging as a key concept in this transition, aiming to produce more energy than they consume on an annual basis. However, the operation of PEDs is increasingly complex due to the integration of multiple energy vectors (electricity, heating, gas, water, etc.), the variability of renewable energy sources, and the need for real-time coordination among distributed assets.<br><br>Resilience —the ability of a system to anticipate, absorb, adapt to, and rapidly recover from disruptions— is a critical yet underexplored dimension in PED operations. This research is a part of an NWO project called “Enabling Positive Energy Districs through citizen-centered socio-technical models for upscaling pf the heat transition” or EmPowerED that studies various aspects of the PEDs to deliver a theoretically informed and empirically validated scalable integrated systems co-creation approach for carbon-neutral heating that can be tailored to the specific local PED context. This PhD is part of the technical study and modelling of the project that needs to focus on a resilience-oriented operational framework for multi-commodity PEDs, addressing both steady-state optimization and dynamic response to disturbances. EmPowerED is a large project with around 38 partners including different universities, research institutes, municipalities, energy communities, distribution system operators, and technology providers. The student will have the opportunity to be a part of this project and participate in project meetings, contribute to the discussion with the end-users, energy communities, and municipalities. There would be close collaboration between the PhD students in this project and the technology providers as the outcomes of the PhD studies could be incorporated into their commercial solutions.<br><br>Current PED operational strategies often prioritize energy efficiency and carbon neutrality but lack mechanisms to ensure resilience against disruptions such as grid outages, extreme weather events, or cyber-physical attacks.

Within the IES program, research is conducted into operation and planning of future sustainable energy systems, with an emphasis on electricity systems, markets and systems integration. This research is performed in two research labs: the Digital power and energy systems lab (EES DigiPES lab) and the Electricity markets and power system optimization lab (EES EMPDO lab). The former focuses on intelligent energy network research, including: demand management and flexibility, digital twinning, data analytics, smart grid ICT architectures and systems integration in multi energy systems. The latter specializes in electricity market design (centralized & decentralized), market products & system services to integrate new technologies, forecasting, market participation strategies and risk management, large-scale, distributed, multi-objective optimization techniques applied to energy markets and power systems and AI for optimization and control in power and energy systems. The EES group has strong ties with industry both nationally and internationally, with several part-time industry researchers working in the group and a large group of strategic collaboration partners.\nRecently, the Electrical Energy Systems group received grants for nationally-funded projects in Intelligent Electricity Systems. Therefore, this group currently has multiple vacancies in this field.\nWe are currently looking for researchers with strong energy systems knowledge, electricity, heat, and gas system components and flexibility modelling & simulation, and research software development skills\nthat want to develop cutting-edge knowledge and software for the\nenergy transition. The focus of the work will be on the application of intelligent software approaches (distributed control systems, distributed optimization, market mechanisms, multi-scale modelling, etc.), in electrical power systems (energy system flexibility coordination, local energy markets, capacity & congestion management, etc.).\nInformation\nThe decarbonization of the industrial sector is critical to achieving climate neutrality. Steam-based industries, such as chemical manufacturing, food processing, and paper production, are among the most energy-intensive and carbon-emitting sectors. Electrification of thermal processes, particularly through the integration of industrial heat pumps, presents a promising pathway to reduce emissions while offering flexibility services to the energy system.\nAt the same time, the increasing penetration of variable renewable energy such as wind and solar creates a pressing need for\nflexibility services\nto balance supply and demand. Industrial processes, with their significant thermal inertia and storage potential, can provide valuable flexibility to the power grid. However, the integration of such services into\nsteam-heated industrial processes\nremains a challenge, especially when considering the role of\nlarge-scale heat pumps,\nindustrial heat storage, and heat recovery technologies\nas both decarbonization and flexibility enablers. The challenge rises from several factors affecting the daily operation of the factories as well as the investment requirements that might not be compensated accordingly when the derived flexibility is offered to the grid/market. In this regard, this PhD focuses on optimizing the use of flexibility in electrified process plants by leveraging dynamic behaviors and market participation.\nWith the above premises, the main objectives of this study are\n- Characterize the thermal demand profiles of steam-based industrial processes and identify opportunities for electrification. => Baseline optimisation\nBaseline optimisation\n- Assess the technical feasibility and performance of industrial heat pumps in steam generation and recovery. => Design options and technology inclusions\nDesign options and technology inclusions\n- Develop models to quantify the flexibility potential of electrified steam systems, including load shifting, demand response, and ancillary services. => Energy use optimisation\nEnergy use optimisation\n- Assess the techno-economic feasibility of providing flexibility services from electrified steam processes. => Business assessment\nBusiness assessment\n- Grid impact assessment and capacity management approaches in an industry-infused network with integrated industrial flexibility services. => Grid impact assessment\nGrid impact assessment\nIn order to achieve these goals, the following tasks would shape the work plan of the PhD:\nEnergy Portfolio Creation:\nA comprehensive estimation of the available flexibility within electrified process plants should be undertaken. This task involves a detailed assessment of the various processes and identifying potential extractable flexibility from electrified thermal systems. The goal is to quantify the extent to which these processes can be adjusted or modulated, taking into account the operational constraints and requirements. This estimation will include analyzing the energy consumption patterns, identifying peak and off-peak periods, and understanding the critical operational parameters that must remain stable. The maximum achievable flexibility that can be harnessed without compromising the efficiency, productivity, and overall operational stability of the process plants can be determined. This rigorous analysis will provide a clear picture of the flexibility potential and set the stage for implementing effective flexibility services tailored to the dynamic behavior of the process industry.\nFlexibility service definition and potential calculations:\nThe next task would be to identify and define flexibility services that are specifically tailored to the dynamic nature of process industries. This involves a thorough examination of the various industrial processes to determine how they can be adapted or modulated to provide flexibility services. The approach includes a detailed analysis of the operational characteristics and requirements of each process, aiming to understand the inherent dynamic behaviors and how they can be leveraged to create flexibility.\nThrough exploring different strategies for modulating processes, such as adjusting production schedules, varying energy consumption rates, and implementing advanced control systems, new definitions for flexibility services from industry will be provided.

Yet, their emergence and timing remain difficult to anticipate and manage. This PhD will develop a machine learning module to detect early warning signals of positive tipping points from techno-economic data, helping policymakers design adaptive strategies for rapid and resilient decarbonization.<br><br>Your research will combine time-series analysis, supervised and unsupervised learning, and explainable AI methods to uncover the dynamic patterns preceding technological breakthroughs or large-scale adoption events. The module will be validated on both historical datasets and scenario data generated by Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), large climate-economic models used for mapping future decarbonization pathways. Building on these insights, you will explore policy portfolios that are responsive to emerging tipping dynamics, assessing their trade-offs. Your key tasks will include:<br><ul> <li>Applying and comparing machine learning methods for time-series analysis and tipping point detection.</li> <li>Developing an interpretable machine learning framework to detect early warning signals of energy transition tipping points.</li> <li>Validating the new module with historical and scenario datasets.</li> <li>Designing adaptive policy portfolios responsive to tipping dynamics within a stylized IAM.</li> <li>Assessing trade-offs in transition outcomes, including economic feasibility, equity, and robustness.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>Your work environment<br><br>You will carry out this research as part of the ERC-funded RIPPLE project, led by Professor Giacomo Marangoni, and embedded within the Policy Analysis section of the Multi-Actor Systems department.

Shortages, trade frictions, and financial mismatches can stall otherwise viable tipping dynamics and establish carbon-intensive lock-ins.\nThis PhD will develop an agent-based inspired module that maps global flows of key materials (e.g., lithium, copper, nickel, tin), climate-finance streams, and trade relationships to derive feasibility and lock-in indicators of alternative transitions to clean energy technologies.

Join TU Delft and develop AI-driven solutions for sustainable, efficient, and collaborative port operations of the future.\nJob description\nEuropean seaports must achieve net zero emission by 2050 and 55% emission reduction (‘fit for 55’) by 2030 as agreed in the European Green Deal and comply with the FuelEU Maritime and EU Emissions Trading System regulations, presenting unprecedented challenges. Up to 80% of the emissions in ports are attributed to the port call process of ships visiting the port. Efforts of a single actor to reduce emissions will be suboptimal, or may even be counterproductive, for the port call process as a whole. In addition, the anticipated sharp surge in demand for electricity and renewable fuels introduces new uncertainties. Would you like to address this urgent need and develop new methods to support coordinated decision-making for sustainable strategies in the port call? As a PhD student at TU Delft, you will leverage AI (i.e. optimization and machine learning techniques) to prepare ports, terminals, shipping companies, and other port actors for this important challenge.\nYour research will be part of the PortCall.Zero project - a five-year project with multiple industry partners such as Port of Rotterdam and APMT/Maersk and overall eight researchers who will work together with you on different aspects towards decarbonized and efficient port calls. In the PortCall.Zero project, you will develop novel AI methods and tools that capture the complexity of the port call process and handle uncertainties caused by the energy transitions. In collaboration with the other researchers, this will include the economic viability of operations and governance aspects. The approach will be demonstrated in the port of Rotterdam and other European ports, putting the project in the leading position globally with the most sustainable and efficient port call processes. The research of the project will be conducted jointly with our industry partners to develop new products and services for ports globally, giving you the opportunity to get involved in cutting-edge research and gain industry experience in close collaboration with our partners.\nApart from the PortCall.Zero community, you will be joining an interdisciplinary and active team of PhD students and professors at the Maritime & Transport Technology department and Transport Engineering & Logistics section.

      "description_en": "Job description\nThe exponential increase of computational power over the last decade has enabled scale-resolving simulations (SRS) of turbulent flows at an unprecedented resolution. In combination with high-performance computing (HPC), parallel computational fluid dynamic simulations can currently resolve spatial and temporal scales of industrially-relevant turbulent flows within days/weeks. On the other hand, typical design cycles in industry still make extensive use of low-fidelity simulations which can provide fast but inaccurate solutions depending on the flow complexity.\nTo close this gap, this PhD will explore machine-learning (ML) methods to significantly reduce the turnaround time of SRS, thus enabling their use for industrial design processes. By combining state-of-the-art numerical methods and data-driven modelling techniques, the PhD candidate will investigate novel frameworks to accelerate SRS in HPC environments.\nThe PhD candidate will work at the Ship Hydrodynamics section of the Department of Maritime and Transport Technology (Faculty of Mechanical Engineering). This environment facilitates the exchange of research knowledge with colleagues also working in CFD and ML, both in applied and fundamental areas. The candidate will develop transferable skills such as HPC software development, extensive physical understanding of turbulent flows, and experience in modern ML architectures such as neural operators and transformers.\nThe expected start date is February 2026, and the PhD duration contract is 4 years.

        "description": "<strong>Job description</strong><br>The exponential increase of computational power over the last decade has enabled scale-resolving simulations (SRS) of turbulent flows at an unprecedented resolution. In combination with high-performance computing (HPC), parallel computational fluid dynamic simulations can currently resolve spatial and temporal scales of industrially-relevant turbulent flows within days/weeks. On the other hand, typical design cycles in industry still make extensive use of low-fidelity simulations which can provide fast but inaccurate solutions depending on the flow complexity.<br><br>To close this gap, this PhD will explore machine-learning (ML) methods to significantly reduce the turnaround time of SRS, thus enabling their use for industrial design processes. By combining state-of-the-art numerical methods and data-driven modelling techniques, the PhD candidate will investigate novel frameworks to accelerate SRS in HPC environments.<br><br>The PhD candidate will work at the Ship Hydrodynamics section of the Department of Maritime and Transport Technology (Faculty of Mechanical Engineering). This environment facilitates the exchange of research knowledge with colleagues also working in CFD and ML, both in applied and fundamental areas. The candidate will develop transferable skills such as HPC software development, extensive physical understanding of turbulent flows, and experience in modern ML architectures such as neural operators and transformers.<br><br>The expected start date is February 2026, and the PhD duration contract is 4 years.

Impact!<br><br><strong>Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science </strong><br>The Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science (EEMCS) brings together three scientific disciplines. Combined, they reinforce each other and are the driving force behind the technology we all use in our daily lives. Technology such as the electricity grid, which our faculty is helping to make completely sustainable and future-proof. At the same time, we are developing the chips and sensors of the future, whilst also setting the foundations for the software technologies to run on this new generation of equipment – which of course includes AI. Meanwhile we are pushing the limits of applied mathematics, for example mapping out disease processes using single cell data, and using mathematics to simulate gigantic ash plumes after a volcanic eruption. In other words: there is plenty of room at the faculty for ground-breaking research. We educate innovative engineers and have excellent labs and facilities that underline our strong international position.

De circulaire transitie vereist een fundamentele transformatie in de manier waarop we materialen gebruiken, produceren en niet langer weggooien, en omvat o.a. het verlengen van productlevenscycli, het vervangen van conventionele materialen door duurzamere alternatieven, en het streven naar meer en hoogwaardiger hergebruik van materialen. Gezamenlijk dragen deze ontwikkelingen bij aan een meer verantwoorde productie en consumptie van materialen, een van de grote uitdagingen van onze tijd. Tegelijkertijd verloopt de circulaire transitie nog steeds trager dan gewenst, en raken doelstellingen buiten bereik. Dit project zal zich gaan richten op de rol die inkoop kan spelen bij het versnellen van de circulaire transitie middels niet, anders en minder inkopen, in lijn met bovengenoemde ontwikkelingen. Dit in samenwerking met de vele publieke en private stakeholders die doorgaans betrokken zijn bij transities.

      "description_en": "Job description\nTACIT Project\nThis position is based within the NWO's Perspectief project, TACIT (Inclusive Technologies for Access and Social Participation). The goal is to co-design AI-enabled adaptive image and schema descriptions for digitized books and collections of the National Library of the Netherlands (KB) for blind and visually impaired readers.\nBackground\nAround 25% of the Dutch population lives with long-term visual, hearing, or cognitive disabilities and diversities, often facing barriers to participation, equity and inclusion. The European Accessibility Act (EAA), which mandates that EU service providers ensure digital accessibility by 2025, marks a critical step toward reducing these inequalities. However, technology that is not co-designed with affected communities often lacks social acceptance and fails to meet real needs. As part of the TACIT (Inclusive Technologies for Access and Social Participation) project, this PhD position will contribute to the co-design and co-creation of AI and immersive media technologies through inclusive Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and participatory design methods. TACIT aims to enhance the accessibility of public services, accelerate the adoption of the EAA, drive innovation in assistive technologies, and promote broader societal inclusion through equitable, inclusive, and human-centered design. The TACIT project is funded by the NWO Perspectief program.\nPosition Overview\nAs part of a larger research initiative, TACIT (Inclusive Technologies for Access and Social Participation), focused on the co-design of inclusive and accessible AI and XR technologies for people with disabilities. The TU Delft Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics & Computer Science (EEMCS) invites applications for a PhD position aimed at developing advanced AI-driven image description systems tailored for blind and visually impaired (BVI) readers, addressing the diverse and evolving needs of users with different types and levels of visual and cognitive diversities. Leveraging large language and multimodal models, the research will focus on developing AI technologies to generate informative, concise, and personalized descriptions that enhance accessibility across various contexts. The candidate will engage in identifying user requirements, fine-tuning models for accessibility tasks, and designing mechanisms that automatically adapt image content to individual user profiles. The project also involves close collaboration with BVI individuals and other stakeholders through participatory design and evaluation, ensuring that the solutions are robust not only technically but also grounded in real-world accessibility needs.\nWe are seeking a highly motivated PhD candidate with a strong interest in artificial intelligence, accessibility, and human-centered design to join the TACIT project. The candidate will work on developing adaptive, AI-driven technologies for people living with blindness and vision impairments. This research will combine technical innovation with inclusive design practices to ensure that the resulting solutions are not only effective but also trusted and adopted by the communities they aim to serve. The ideal candidate is passionate about creating socially impactful technology and eager to engage directly with people with disabilities, caretakers and relevant stakeholders, through co-design and participatory research.\nThe successful PhD candidate will be based at the intersection of the Web Information Systems Group (EEMCS Faculty, TU Delft, https://www.wis.ewi.tudelft.nl) and the Knowledge and Intelligence Design Group (IDE Faculty, TU Delft, https://kind.fyi). The candidate will also be co-hosted by the KB, the National Library of the Netherlands (https://www.kb.nl/).\nTU Delft (Delft University of Technology)\nDelft University of Technology is built on strong foundations. As creators of the world-famous Dutch waterworks and pioneers in biotech, TU Delft is a top international university combining science, engineering and design. It delivers world class results in education, research and innovation to address challenges in the areas of energy, climate, mobility, health and digital society.

Your application will receive fair consideration.\nChallenge. Change. Impact!\nFaculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science\nThe Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science (EEMCS) brings together three scientific disciplines. Combined, they reinforce each other and are the driving force behind the technology we all use in our daily lives. Technology such as the electricity grid, which our faculty is helping to make completely sustainable and future-proof. At the same time, we are developing the chips and sensors of the future, whilst also setting the foundations for the software technologies to run on this new generation of equipment – which of course includes AI. Meanwhile we are pushing the limits of applied mathematics, for example mapping out disease processes using single cell data, and using mathematics to simulate gigantic ash plumes after a volcanic eruption. In other words: there is plenty of room at the faculty for ground-breaking research. We educate innovative engineers and have excellent labs and facilities that underline our strong international position. In total, more than 1000 employees and 4,000 students work and study in this innovative environment.\nClick\nhere\nto go to the website of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science.\nConditions of employment\nDoctoral candidates will be offered a 4-year period of employment in principle, but in the form of 2 employment contracts. An initial 1,5 year contract with an official go/no go progress assessment within 15 months. Followed by an additional contract for the remaining 2,5 years assuming everything goes well and performance requirements are met.\nSalary and benefits are in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities, increasing from €3059 - €3881 gross per month, from the first year to the fourth year based on a fulltime contract (38 hours), plus 8% holiday allowance and an end-of-year bonus of 8.3%.\nAs a PhD candidate you will be enrolled in the TU Delft Graduate School. The TU Delft Graduate School provides an inspiring research environment with an excellent team of supervisors, academic staff and a mentor. The Doctoral Education Programme is aimed at developing your transferable, discipline-related and research skills.\nThe TU Delft offers a customisable compensation package, discounts on health insurance, and a monthly work costs contribution. Flexible work schedules can be arranged.\nWill you need to relocate to the Netherlands for this job? TU Delft is committed to make your move as smooth as possible! The HR unit,\nComing to Delft Service\n, offers information on their website to help you prepare your relocation. In addition, Coming to Delft Service organises events to help you settle in the Netherlands, and expand your (social) network in Delft. A\nDual Career Programme\nis available, to support your accompanying partner with their job search in the Netherlands.\nAdditional information\nIf you would like more information about this vacancy or the selection procedure, please contact Dr. Jie Yang or Dr. Himanshu Verma, via j.yang-3@tudelft.nl of h.verma@tudelft.nl.\nJanuary 4, 2026\n, via the application button below.\nApplicants should send their CV, and a cover letter outlining your qualifications, including a sample of scientific writing (e.g., published paper, thesis excerpt, or project report). Please note that if you lean too heavily on ChatGPT or a similar Generative AI application, your application letter will be very generic and difficult for us to judge.\nDoing a PhD at TU Delft requires English proficiency at a certain level to ensure that the candidate is able to communicate and interact well, participate in English-taught Doctoral Education courses, and write scientific articles and a final thesis.

      "description_en": "Challenge: Cost-effective passenger railways\nChange: Integrating planning of rolling stock circulations and rolling stock maintenance\nImpact: Improved railway logistics\nJob description\nPassenger railway transport plays an essential role in sustainable mobility. It is based on dedicated railway infrastructure, rolling stock and personnel that need to be aligned by efficient planning and replanning to optimize the allocation of the resources and maintain reliable operations in face of disturbances and disruptions. Rolling stock (or railway vehicles) also needs regular maintenance at service locations including inspections, cleaning, and repairs. Incidents during operations such as broken toilets or failing doors may also trigger changes to the plans to prioritize maintenance to these specific train units. The interaction between rolling stock circulations and regular maintenance, including the uncertainties involved, leads to complex logistics problems.\nThe planning of rolling stock circulations and the regular maintenance at the various service locations is typically done by different planners. In addition, shunting train units between the station platforms and the service locations further complicates the operations (re)planning and involves yet other planners and (shunting) personnel. While regular rolling stock maintenance used to be executed largely in the evening or at night such that all rolling stock is available during the day, saturating capacity at service locations and attractive working hours for personnel require alternative solutions, such as moving rolling stock maintenance to daytime on days or periods with less transport demand.\nThe objective of this PhD project is to develop and demonstrate a methodology for integrated planning of railway rolling stock circulations, regular maintenance and train unit shunting. The integrated planning offers opportunities such as reduced rolling stock with equal seat availability, more attractive working hours at service locations, and decreased train unit movements for regular maintenance. New innovative approaches need to be developed to schedule rolling stock to timetables and service locations while considering requirements of various personnel and special requests during operations based on specific train unit conditions. This requires multiple-criteria decision-making methods to find effective and efficient integrated planning solutions based on existing tools at Netherlands Railways and newly developed optimization models. Simulation studies will be applied to test and demonstrate the developed concepts and algorithms for integrated (re)planning. This PhD research will use a mixture of techniques from logistics, operations research, multiple-criteria decision making and simulation.\nYou will work in the Digital Rail Traffic Lab (DRTLab) and the Smart Public Transport Lab (SPTL) within the Department of Transport and Planning (T&P) at Delft University of Technology. You will be supervised by Prof. Rob Goverde and Dr. Niels van Oort, in close cooperation with Netherlands Railways. T&P is part of the Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences at TU Delft. In the past 30 years, the department has grown into a world-leading centre for transport science and engineering, providing top-level education and world-class scientific research. The Department is organized in collaborative research labs, including the DRTLab and SPTL. The DRTLab develops innovative concepts, models and methods for resilient railway transport systems. SPTL develops new solutions and methods for public transport planning, operations and management. You will also work one day per week at the Department Digitalization of Operations of Netherlands Railways.\nTU Delft (Delft University of Technology)\nDelft University of Technology is built on strong foundations. As creators of the world-famous Dutch waterworks and pioneers in biotech, TU Delft is a top international university combining science, engineering and design.
