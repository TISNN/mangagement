      "description_en": "Join our ERC SPHINX Team to model how climate risks ripple through housing markets. Help uncover when homes become stranded assets and fuel systemic impacts. Help shaping climate resilient policies!\nJob description\nThis 4-year fully funded PhD position is part of the ERC Consolidator project “Systemic physical climate risk in complex adaptive economies” (SPHINX). The SPHINX-research program is made possible thanks to a 2-million-euro grant from the European Research Council.\nBackground:\nGlobally, climate change already manifests via physical risks – damages from floods, storms, wildfires, heatwaves, droughts, and sea-level rise. Concerns are rising that these risks may become systemic, when local damages to one element cannot be contained and adversely affect the entire socio-economic system. Usually, physical climate risk assessments overlay hazard probability, exposure and vulnerability. These future damage estimates linearly extrapolate historic data, assuming that markets efficiently capitalize full information about climate risks and adjust gradually, economic actors have perfect future insight, and socio-economic systems will react to and price unprecedented climate-induced hazards as they did in the past. This approach is criticized for underestimating the true costs of climate change (e.g., at just 1-3% of GDP loss even under severe scenarios), impeding climate action. In contrast, analysis of systemic risks embraces complex interactions among elements/agents, adjusting expectations, mechanisms of contagion dynamics, feedbacks, and non-linear tipping. The SPHINX research program aims to fundamentally advance simulation methods and consolidate novel data to understand how systemic physical climate risks emerge in the socio-economic system, and to explore strategies to curtail their spiraling costs. The project focuses on Europe, with a detailed analysis of three selected case-study regions. Methodologically, SPHINX embraces five pillars, ranging from data collection to agent-based and computable general equilibrium modeling, led by five team members. The first three pillars concern the development of computational agent-based models to explore three different channels of risk propagation with a focus on the triggers of systemic risks. The current PhD position aims to advance assessments of physical climate risks for governments, including the emergence of moral hazard and inequality in the allocation of climate adaptation funding, as well as collateral damage to their budgets.\nJob description:\nThe successful candidate will work within the SPHINX research team to explore how governments balance economic development objectives with adaptation to accelerating physical climate risks, as households-voters decide where to live given their preferences for public adaptation. To explore the emergence of moral hazard and fiscal strain for governments under shifting climate risks, the candidate will develop an agent-based model grounded in the Tiebout theory and supported by data, including data on public preferences for allocating adaptation funds. During this 4-year-long project, the PhD student will build on the latest progress in economic research on changes in governmental debt and collateral fiscal damages, and instances of moral hazard and loss of creditworthiness for governments facing escalating climate risks. Connecting the mutually dependent decisions of governments to provide and fund public adaptation, and the location choices of diverse private actors in an agent-based model will be essential here. This modeling effort will benefit from the behavioral data on expectations elicited via tailored household and firm surveys (carried out by another team member) and other spatial and physical climate risk data. The goal of this agent-based modeling is to identify conditions under which risk contagion causes regional decline, and the roots of changing inequality based on how local governments decide on the level of public adaptation provision contingent on both households’ preferences for it and the availability of sufficient tax-based governmental budgets to afford it.\nTU Delft (Delft University of Technology)\nDelft University of Technology is built on strong foundations.

      "description_en": "Heb jij een master in de sociale wetenschappen afgerond? En wil jij bijdragen aan de organisatie van zorgzame buurten zodat de zorg toekomstbestendig wordt? En zou je graag willen promoveren op een plek waar actuele zorgvraagstukken, wetenschappelijk onderzoek en een internationaal kennisnetwerk samenkomen? Bij de vakgroep Healthcare Governance (HCG) van Erasmus School of Health Policy & Management (ESHPM) zijn wij op zoek naar een gemotiveerde en enthousiaste promovendus die etnografisch actieonderzoek wil doen naar samenwerking tussen verschillende publieke organisaties, tech bedrijven, mantelzorgers en ouderen met als gemeenschappelijke uitdaging: hoe maken we samenredzame buurten van de toekomst met behulp van nieuwe zorgrelaties tussen professionals, ouderen en familie, met oog voor waarden en met passende inzet van technologie?\nProjectbeschrijving\nDe Nederlandse gezondheidszorg staat voor grote uitdagingen door de snel vergrijzende bevolking. Deze demografische verschuiving zorgt voor een toenemende zorgvraag en druk op professionele zorgverlening. Om de druk op deze formele zorg te verlichten, pleit de Nederlandse overheid voor een maatschappelijke transitie van ‘ouderenzorg’ naar ‘zorg voor ouderen’. Hierin worden ouderen gestimuleerd om zo lang mogelijk thuis te wonen en zorg in hun eigen omgeving te ontvangen, ondersteund door een actievere rol voor mantelzorgers. Hoewel de noodzaak van deze transitie door veel partijen wordt erkend, brengt deze ook grote uitdagingen met zich mee. Veel mantelzorgers staan namelijk nu al voor enorme lasten, vaak in combinatie met werk en andere verplichtingen.\nIn hun zoektocht naar oplossingen brengen politici, beleidsmakers en zorgorganisaties twee verschillende richtingen naar voren. De eerste richting is het versterken van\nsamenredzaamheid\n. Het centrale idee achter samenredzaamheid is het faciliteren van thuis wonen door middel van nieuwe (informele) zorgnetwerken, waarin zorgverlening als een collectieve inspanning wordt gezien, die is gebaseerd op ondersteuning binnen gemeenschappen. De tweede richting is\ntechnologische innovatie\nals middel om zelfredzaamheid te bevorderen. Technologie en digitalisering worden gezien als cruciale instrumenten om de ouderenzorg duurzaam te houden, taken te automatiseren die traditioneel door formele zorgverleners worden uitgevoerd en ziekenhuisbezoeken te verminderen.\nHoewel samenredzaamheid en technologische innovatie beide gericht zijn op het aanpakken van dezelfde crisis, worden ze grotendeels los van elkaar nagestreefd. In de ontwikkeling van technologie is daardoor vaak weinig oog voor de rol van (informele) zorggemeenschappen, terwijl beleids- en buurtinitiatieven op het terrein van samenredzaamheid vaak weinig aandacht hebben voor mogelijke manieren waarop technologie dit soort initiatieven zou kunnen ondersteunen. Een belangrijke reden hiervoor is dat deze twee oplossingsrichtingen lijken te vertrekken vanuit verschillende onderliggende\nwaarden\n. Zo richt veel technologie zich op efficiëntie en optimalisatie van processen, terwijl initiatieven op het terrein van samenredzaamheid juist relationele verbondenheid hoog in het vaandel hebben staan. Het gevolg is dat veel technologische innovaties op weerstand stuiten, beperkte acceptatie en moeizame inbedding in informele praktijken van zorgverlening, terwijl initiatieven gericht op samenredzaamheid technologische oplossingen niet benutten. Kortom: technologische innovaties passen vaak niet vanzelf in de sociale praktijken van informele netwerken terwijl omgekeerd deze initiatieven de meerwaarde van technologie niet zondermeer zien of omarmen.\nWat ga je doen?\nAls promovendus voer je etnografisch actieonderzoek uit naar een complex en actueel publiek vraagstuk dat in heel Nederland speelt: hoe kunnen verschillende organisaties samenwerken aan een duurzame organisatie van samenredzame buurten waarbij de inzet van technologie goed aansluit bij waarden van ouderen die langer thuis wonen? Partijen die aan je onderzoek meewerken zijn o.a. ouderenorganisaties, verzekeraars, mantelzorgorganisaties, welzijnsinstanties en gemeenten. Zij geven ieder een eigen invulling aan samenredzaamheid en de inzet van technologie thuis. En zij hebben vaak verschillende waarden en belangen die soms botsen in de samenwerking. Deze waardencomplexiteit is het centrale uitgangspunt van het onderzoek en ligt ten grondslag aan de centrale onderzoeksvraag: welke verschillende waarden prioriteren actoren in de samenwerking rondom samenredzame buurten & de inzet van technologie (zoals thuismonitoring maar ook burenapps voor onderling contact)?\nJe brengt niet alleen in kaart welke waardencomplexiteit en conflicten er onderling spelen, maar je doet ook zelf actieonderzoek. Je koppelt relevante inzichten terug aan organisaties, je geeft advies en organiseert workshops. Je onderzoek vertaalt zich zo naar directe maatschappelijke impact. Je draagt bij aan vragen als: hoe kunnen we het beste omgaan met waardenconflicten in de samenwerking? Welke organisatorische randvoorwaarden zijn nodig voor zorgzame buurten van de toekomst? Wat vraagt dit van het zorgsysteem? Je onderzoek heeft daarmee een etnografisch, actiegerichte focus, waarbij samen leren en experimenteren met verschillende organisaties centraal staat.\nJe werkt mee aan het door NWO gefinancierde project\nCARE VISiON (Collaborative Approaches to Reimagining Elder Care: Values-driven Innovations in Samenredzaamheid for Older adults in the Netherlands)\nen maakt deel uit van een geïntegreerd team bestaande uit vier promovendi en twee postdocs. Je empirisch onderzoek levert kritische input voor de ontwikkeling van een interdisciplinair conceptueel kader en een transdisciplinaire visie en tools voor productieve waardenafstemming.\nJe gaat werken in de sectie Healthcare Governance van de Erasmus School of Health Policy & Management (ESHPM), een actieve groep van (PhD-)onderzoekers die vanuit verschillende disciplines empirisch onderzoek uitvoeren naar sturings- en beleidsvraagstukken in de zorg. Daarnaast is er een nauwe samenwerking met de Erasmus School of Social & Behavioral Sciences, in het bijzonder de Erasmus Social Design Hub, met veel expertise op het gebied van ontwerpgericht sociaal-wetenschappelijk onderzoek rond maatschappelijke vraagstukken.\nBegeleiding\nHet begeleidingsteam bestaat uit dr. Lieke Oldenhof (Healthcare Governance, ESHPM), dr. Rik Wehrens (Healthcare Governance, ESHPM) en prof. Arwin van Buuren (ESSB).",

        "title": "PhD Toekomstbestendige Organisatie van Zorgzame Buurten",
        "description": "<em>Heb jij een master in de sociale wetenschappen afgerond? En wil jij bijdragen aan de organisatie van zorgzame buurten zodat de zorg toekomstbestendig wordt? En zou je graag willen promoveren op een plek waar actuele zorgvraagstukken, wetenschappelijk onderzoek en een internationaal kennisnetwerk samenkomen? Bij de vakgroep Healthcare Governance (HCG) van Erasmus School of Health Policy &amp; Management (ESHPM) zijn wij op zoek naar een gemotiveerde en enthousiaste promovendus die etnografisch actieonderzoek wil doen naar samenwerking tussen verschillende publieke organisaties, tech bedrijven, mantelzorgers en ouderen met als gemeenschappelijke uitdaging: hoe maken we samenredzame buurten van de toekomst met behulp van nieuwe zorgrelaties tussen professionals, ouderen en familie, met oog voor waarden en met passende inzet van technologie?</em><br><br><strong>Projectbeschrijving</strong><br>De Nederlandse gezondheidszorg staat voor grote uitdagingen door de snel vergrijzende bevolking. Deze demografische verschuiving zorgt voor een toenemende zorgvraag en druk op professionele zorgverlening. Om de druk op deze formele zorg te verlichten, pleit de Nederlandse overheid voor een maatschappelijke transitie van ‘ouderenzorg’ naar ‘zorg voor ouderen’. Hierin worden ouderen gestimuleerd om zo lang mogelijk thuis te wonen en zorg in hun eigen omgeving te ontvangen, ondersteund door een actievere rol voor mantelzorgers. Hoewel de noodzaak van deze transitie door veel partijen wordt erkend, brengt deze ook grote uitdagingen met zich mee. Veel mantelzorgers staan namelijk nu al voor enorme lasten, vaak in combinatie met werk en andere verplichtingen.<br><br>In hun zoektocht naar oplossingen brengen politici, beleidsmakers en zorgorganisaties twee verschillende richtingen naar voren. De eerste richting is het versterken van <em>samenredzaamheid</em>. Het centrale idee achter samenredzaamheid is het faciliteren van thuis wonen door middel van nieuwe (informele) zorgnetwerken, waarin zorgverlening als een collectieve inspanning wordt gezien, die is gebaseerd op ondersteuning binnen gemeenschappen. De tweede richting is <em>technologische innovatie</em> als middel om zelfredzaamheid te bevorderen. Technologie en digitalisering worden gezien als cruciale instrumenten om de ouderenzorg duurzaam te houden, taken te automatiseren die traditioneel door formele zorgverleners worden uitgevoerd en ziekenhuisbezoeken te verminderen.<br><br>Hoewel samenredzaamheid en technologische innovatie beide gericht zijn op het aanpakken van dezelfde crisis, worden ze grotendeels los van elkaar nagestreefd. In de ontwikkeling van technologie is daardoor vaak weinig oog voor de rol van (informele) zorggemeenschappen, terwijl beleids- en buurtinitiatieven op het terrein van samenredzaamheid vaak weinig aandacht hebben voor mogelijke manieren waarop technologie dit soort initiatieven zou kunnen ondersteunen. Een belangrijke reden hiervoor is dat deze twee oplossingsrichtingen lijken te vertrekken vanuit verschillende onderliggende <em>waarden</em>. Zo richt veel technologie zich op efficiëntie en optimalisatie van processen, terwijl initiatieven op het terrein van samenredzaamheid juist relationele verbondenheid hoog in het vaandel hebben staan. Het gevolg is dat veel technologische innovaties op weerstand stuiten, beperkte acceptatie en moeizame inbedding in informele praktijken van zorgverlening, terwijl initiatieven gericht op samenredzaamheid technologische oplossingen niet benutten. Kortom: technologische innovaties passen vaak niet vanzelf in de sociale praktijken van informele netwerken terwijl omgekeerd deze initiatieven de meerwaarde van technologie niet zondermeer zien of omarmen.<br><br><strong>Wat ga je doen?</strong><br>Als promovendus voer je etnografisch actieonderzoek uit naar een complex en actueel publiek vraagstuk dat in heel Nederland speelt: hoe kunnen verschillende organisaties samenwerken aan een duurzame organisatie van samenredzame buurten waarbij de inzet van technologie goed aansluit bij waarden van ouderen die langer thuis wonen? Partijen die aan je onderzoek meewerken zijn o.a. ouderenorganisaties, verzekeraars, mantelzorgorganisaties, welzijnsinstanties en gemeenten. Zij geven ieder een eigen invulling aan samenredzaamheid en de inzet van technologie thuis. En zij hebben vaak verschillende waarden en belangen die soms botsen in de samenwerking. Deze waardencomplexiteit is het centrale uitgangspunt van het onderzoek en ligt ten grondslag aan de centrale onderzoeksvraag: welke verschillende waarden prioriteren actoren in de samenwerking rondom samenredzame buurten &amp; de inzet van technologie (zoals thuismonitoring maar ook burenapps voor onderling contact)?<br><br>Je brengt niet alleen in kaart welke waardencomplexiteit en conflicten er onderling spelen, maar je doet ook zelf actieonderzoek. Je koppelt relevante inzichten terug aan organisaties, je geeft advies en organiseert workshops. Je onderzoek vertaalt zich zo naar directe maatschappelijke impact. Je draagt bij aan vragen als: hoe kunnen we het beste omgaan met waardenconflicten in de samenwerking? Welke organisatorische randvoorwaarden zijn nodig voor zorgzame buurten van de toekomst? Wat vraagt dit van het zorgsysteem? Je onderzoek heeft daarmee een etnografisch, actiegerichte focus, waarbij samen leren en experimenteren met verschillende organisaties centraal staat.<br><br>Je werkt mee aan het door NWO gefinancierde project <em>CARE VISiON (Collaborative Approaches to Reimagining Elder Care: Values-driven Innovations in Samenredzaamheid for Older adults in the Netherlands)</em> en maakt deel uit van een geïntegreerd team bestaande uit vier promovendi en twee postdocs. Je empirisch onderzoek levert kritische input voor de ontwikkeling van een interdisciplinair conceptueel kader en een transdisciplinaire visie en tools voor productieve waardenafstemming.<br><br>Je gaat werken in de sectie Healthcare Governance van de Erasmus School of Health Policy &amp; Management (ESHPM), een actieve groep van (PhD-)onderzoekers die vanuit verschillende disciplines empirisch onderzoek uitvoeren naar sturings- en beleidsvraagstukken in de zorg. Daarnaast is er een nauwe samenwerking met de Erasmus School of Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences, in het bijzonder de Erasmus Social Design Hub, met veel expertise op het gebied van ontwerpgericht sociaal-wetenschappelijk onderzoek rond maatschappelijke vraagstukken.<br><br><strong>Begeleiding</strong><br>Het begeleidingsteam bestaat uit dr. Lieke Oldenhof (Healthcare Governance, ESHPM), dr. Rik Wehrens (Healthcare Governance, ESHPM) en prof. Arwin van Buuren (ESSB).",
