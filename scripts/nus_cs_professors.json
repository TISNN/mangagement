      "profile": "My research focuses on algorithms for large-scale distributed systems, with a particular interest in issues of scalability and fault-tolerance. Examples include the following topics:\n- Wireless networks: In the context of wireless networks, I have explored the question of how we can use dynamic spectrum access (and multichannel wireless networking) to improve the reliability and efficiency of communication protocols.\n- Contention resolution: A closely related problem is contention resolution, where the goal is to efficiently share access to a limited resource (such as a wireless channel or a shared lock). It is quite difficult to ensure good throughput in a dynamic system, with a constantly changing number of participants. It is even more difficult to make such a protocol robust.\n- Dynamic networks: In general, dynamic networks with changing participants, varying connections, and unpredictable latencies create many challenges even in classical wired networks. We have studied several problems in such settings, including gossip protocols, consensus protocols, leader election, and random walks.\n- Optimization/Reallocation: I am also interested in a variety of optimization problems, particularly for dynamic systems. For example, consider maintaining a good schedule, even as jobs are added and removed from the schedule. How often do you have to reallocate existing jobs to ensure an efficient allocation? These types of resource allocation (and reallocation) problems show up frequently in dynamic systems.",

From 2012 to 2016, he spent two years each as a postdoctoral researcher at New York University and at EPFL. Since 2016, he has been a faculty member in the Department of Computer Science, and a Principal Investigator in the Centre for Quantum Technologies at the National University of Singapore. His research in the last decade has revolved around the following two themes.\n\n1. Fine-grained complexity, and exponential algorithms for hard problems: A primary focus has been to understand the time complexity and the relation between the computational complexity of various computational problems, particularly lattice problems. This includes both finding faster algorithms and proving lower bounds under reasonable complexity theoretic assumptions. \n\n2. Randomization has played a very important role in many areas of computer science. In practice, a source has some entropy but is not uniformly random. The goal of transforming these imperfect random sources into perfectly random bits has, over the last few decades, led to a large body of research on the theory of randomness extractors and related primitives, and their applications in classical areas like privacy amplification, and tamper-resilient cryptography. Some of his recent research centers around improving construction of such extractors in various settings, and their applications.",

      "profile": "Siau-Cheng Khoo is an Associate Professor in Department of Computer Science and Co-director of the NUS Business Analytics Centre. His research focuses on improving productivity of software developers, and he has expertise in both the formal and practical aspects of programming languages and software engineering. He has designed and developed static program analysis and dynamic program optimization techniques that improve programmer productivity. He has abundant knowledge in inferring of semantic attributes for code and in applying sound and optimized code search techniques. He has also applied advanced programming language theories to the design and implementation of a domain-specific language that helps investors analyze financial data. He has been doing extensive research in adapting and inventing new dynamic analyses that enable discovery of dynamic program behaviours and program bugs via data-mining techniques, which has been termed “specification mining.” His research has been published in top-tier conferences, such as OOPSLA, PLDI, ICSE, ASE, KDD, and ICDE. He has much experience in supervising graduate students and leading research projects. He has successfully completed and is working on multiple research projects funded by DSTA, MOE (Tier 1 & 2), and A*Star. \n\nTogether with colleagues from NUS Business School, Siau-Cheng helped to set up the NUS Business Analytics Centre to oversee the operation of Master of Science programme in Business Analytics. The Centre was established in 2013 with close collaboration with Economic Development Board of Singapore and IBM. Its primary goal is to train Business Analysts to meet the industry need for professionals who can apply analytics technology to business problems. Siau-Cheng is currently the Co-director of the Centre.",

      "profile": "Prof. Hon Wai Leong is with the Department of Computer Science and the University Scholars' Programme (USP) at the National University of Singapore. He received the B.Sc. (Hon) degree in Mathematics from the University of Malaya, and the PhD degree in Computer Science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He joined NUS Department of Computer Science in 1987. Before joining NUS, he was Assistant Professor at UIUC Computer Science department from 1985-1987. In NUS, he held various management positions in the past, including Division Head for Computer Science and Assistant Dean for Special Programmes. He was Curriculum Chair and led the radical change to a modular system and moved the curriculum in line with ACM Curricula-91 recommendations. \n\nDuring his early years, he pioneered many things in NUS (and received many arrows on his back) -- first to give an \"Open Book\" exam, first to give a \"Take-Home\" exam, establishing the \"practical examinations\" for introductory programming courses. He was the first to employ senior undergraduates to teach tutorial and lab classes (and got many phone-calls from \"upstairs\"). At the time, he had to power of persuasion to get students to volunteer (and be paid) -- and they did well -- and the practice was later made official. That was in 1994. The practice is now \"standard\" in many departments in NUS. \n\nProf Leong's research interest is in the design of efficient algorithms for solving computational problems from many diverse application areas including VLSI-CAD, transportation logistics, multimedia systems, and most recently, bioinformatics and computational biology. (See his research publications for more details.) \n\nIn teaching, Prof. Leong strives to find simple ways to explain complicated concepts and subject matters. He specializes in nurturing creative problem solving, creative thinking, and growth mindset-change. He has taught many courses including introductory programming, data structures, algorithm design and analysis, combinatorial and graph algorithms, discrete mathematics, problem solving in computing, and creative problem solving. \n\nHe teaches several highly popular short summer courses on \"Computational Thinking\" and \"Algorithms for Community Detection in Graphs from Big Data\". He also teach a popular multi-disciplinary course, UIT2201 \"Computer Science and the IT Revolution\", in the USP (University Scholars' Programme). He is now involved in teaching GEQ1000: \"Asking Questions\", a university-wide General Education module that is compulsory for all NUS freshman. \n\nHe has a passion for working with and nurturing young talents. Over the past 30 years in NUS, he regularly gives outreach talks and workshops to high school students to excite them about mathematics and computer science. He mentored high school student research projects under the Science Research Programme (SRP), the Science Mentorship Programme (SMP), etc from the Ministry of Education. He started the Singapore training programme for the International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) in 1992, and the National Olympiad in Informatics (NOI) in 1998. He had nurtured many generations of Singapore IOI teams. Since 2007, he co-organizes an annual 24-hour code-jam competition called CXA (code::XtremeApps). He chairs the Junior Category in CXA that pioneered the use of platforms like Alice, Scratch, makey-makey, and micro-bit for primary school students. He is also involved in the Maker movement in Singapore. He regularly has a booth in Maker Faire Singapore, where he does MatheMAGIC to entice young and old to discover the beauty, fun, and applicability of mathematics and computing. \n\nProf. Leong is a member of ACM, IEEE, ISCB, and a Fellow of the Singapore Computer Society. He served on the ExCo of the Singapore Computer Society (SCS) starting in 1994. In SCS, he was involved in the SIG-Board (with Andrew Samson, Harish Pillay, Gerard Tan, Benjamin Tan and others), in organizing numerous conferences, including the big SEARCC'99 conference in Singapore. Between 2003-2007, he was Chair of the SCS IT Leaders Award Committee. In 2007, when three of his students were also serving at the same ExCo, he decided it is best to leave it to younger, more energetic people. \n\nHis current passion is on spreading Computational Thinking to A&E (anyone and everyone). In NUS, he teaches the course, GET1031: \"Computational Thinking\" which teaches CT (no coding) to non-major students in NUS. He is also spreading CT to high school students and teachers, encouraging them to incorporate CT in their K-12 (Kindergarten to Grade-12) classes. He is also known to use origami as a creative way to illustrate algorithms. \n\nIf you are interested in joining him in this \"CT for K-12\" mission, do contact him.",

He has served as a research intern at the NVIDIA AI Technology Center, where he explored embedding knowledge as factor graphs in AI agents, and at the SEA AI Lab, where he researched planning inductive bias to improve DRL generalization.\n\nHis primary research interests lie in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and generalization in machine learning (ML), with a recent focus on Large Language Models (LLMs). Currently, he is interested in understanding the limits of LLMs and exploring how they could be leveraged to improve generalization in DRL.\n\nOn the teaching front, his aim is to build tools to help educators scale their courses and promote self-directed learning and exploration among students. To that end, he has initiated several projects such as AlgoSandbox.com, a platform that encourages students to experiment and play with algorithms and problems, and an AI Contest Platform utilized in courses like CS4246/5446, enabling the courses to scale effectively.",

Before joining NUS, Suranga worked as an Associate Professor at the Auckland Bioengineering Institute, University of Auckland. Prior to that, he was with the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) as an Assistant Professor and was also a Postdoctoral Associate at the MIT Media Lab.\n\nHe received his Ph.D. in 2010 and B.Eng. in 2005 from the National University of Singapore. In 2011, he founded the \"Augmented Human Lab\" to explore ways of designing intelligent human-computer interfaces that extend the limits of our perceptual and cognitive capabilities.\n\nSuranga's work is most important to the people whose lives it directly impacts: those who face challenges functioning in our world due to sensory deficits in hearing or vision. More importantly, the technologies that Suranga has developed are not only applicable to those specific communities but potentially have a broader range of applications, due to his emphasis on “enabling,” rather than “fixing.”\n\nSuranga is a Senior Member of ACM and has taken on a number of roles, including General Chair of the Augmented Human Conference in 2015. He has also served on many review and program committees, including SIGCHI, TEI, and UIST. With publications in prestigious conferences, demonstrations, patents, media coverage, and real-world deployments, Suranga has demonstrated the potential of advancing state-of-the-art technology in assistive human-computer interfaces. For the totality and breadth of his achievements, he has won many awards, including MIT Tech Review’s Young Inventor Under 35 Award (TR35) in the Asia Pacific region, the Outstanding Young Persons of Sri Lanka (TOYP) Award, and the INK Fellowship 2016.",

      "profile": "Colin is a senior lecturer at the Department of Computer Science, NUS School of Computing. He specializes in embedded systems and operating systems related courses. Colin has taught courses on real-time system design, operating systems, programming methodology, and had taught a course on software product development for digital markets. In this course students are given a semester to build three production quality software systems, with the first two being on Facebook and on HTML5, and in the third project students are given free rein on the technologies that they would like to use. The third project is particularly beneficial to students, as they get real first-hand experience in building a software product, from conceptualizing, validating their concept with users, to User Interface (UI) design, UI validation with users, building the system, and finally to marketing their systems to recruit thousands of users before their project submission deadline. Projects completed in this module have spawned startups like Pearcomms, HunQRy and PaperBaton, while alumni in this course have gone on to careers in tech giants like Facebook, Google and Microsoft.\n\nColin, together with two other CS colleagues and three ECE colleagues, is currently teaching a course that gives first-year Computer Engineering students first-hand experience in building non-trivial computer systems like tele-operated robots. Students learn key issues of high-efficiency hardware programming, dealing with electro-mechanical issues like variations in motor and gearbox quality, secure network communications, and real-time mapping of the environment using algorithms like SLAM. They also pick up key skills like performing independent research, and learning how to improvise to solve problems with limited resources. Colin also runs courses in drone design, construction and programming.\n\nColin has written a lightweight operating system for the Arduino called ArdOS that fits into less than a kilobyte of memory, available at https://bitbucket.org/ctank/ardos-ide/wiki/Home. He has also written several other libraries for the Arduino including smartTimer, a library for writing timer-based embedded systems, which also includes a software-based real-time clock for the Arduino, and smartSerial, a bare-metal bare-bones serial communications library for the Arduino. His Bitbucket repository is available at https://www.bitbucket.org/ctank.\n\nColin is Lab Coordinator for Makers@SoC, a maker space that was recently set up to give students a chance to immerse themselves in maker culture, which is a blend of DIY and technology. Makers@SoC addresses two key concerns of the industry: that we are producing technology professionals who can only code and cannot build anything physical - a key concern in fields like IoT - and that CS majors may not have a good appreciation of the hardware on which they build their systems. Makers@SoC runs courses in 3D modeling, basic electronics, microcontroller interfacing and programming, circuit design and fabrication, and through-hole and surface-mount soldering.\n\nColin is Chairperson for the IT Software Solutions for Business trade for Worldskills Singapore 2016 and Worldskills Singapore 2018, and has been a long-time General Secretary for the National Olympiad for Informatics (NOI) competition. Outside of academia Colin reads widely into Catholic theology, is a sponsor and a speaker at the Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults (RCIA) Programme, and is a council member and a formation instructor at the Secular Order of Discalced Carmelites (OCDS) in the Roman Catholic Church of Singapore. He is also an avid foodie, a cigar collector, an enthusiast of retro technology, and a somewhat decent and fairly eclectic cook.",
